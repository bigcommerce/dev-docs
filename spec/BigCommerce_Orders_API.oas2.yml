        **Notes**  

        `tracking_carrier` is optional, but if you include it, its value must
        refer/map to the same carrier service as the `shipping_provider` value.
        Acceptable values for `tracking_carrier` are an empty string (`""`), or
        one of the valid tracking-carrier values viewable
        [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w9c_aECSCGyf-oOrvGeUniDl-ARGKemfZl0qSsav8D4/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)

      summary: Get All Shipping Quotes

        Gets any shipping quotes assocated to an order. 


        This is a read only enpoint and the output can vary based on the
        shipping quote. A shipping quote can only be generated using the
        storefront at this time. Orders that are created in the control panel or
        via api return a 204 for this endpoint since a shipping quote is not
        generated during that process.
