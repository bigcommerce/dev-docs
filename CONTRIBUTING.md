3. Make edits in your favorite code editor
4. Commit and pushes changes to your remote repo

## Commit Messages
* Always include subject; include body when necessary
* Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

* Separate subject from body with a blank line
* Limit the subject line to 50 characters
* Capitalize the subject line
* Do not end the subject line with a period
