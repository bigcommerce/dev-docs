name: To-dos API Mock Server
description: >-
  This Prism instance includes one global API that references the main.oas2
  specification in this repository. This OpenAPI specification defines the
  examples and schemas that drive the mock data. This instance also has one rule
  that runs a scenario in the before phase of all requests, to generate and set
  the mock data on the response. You can swap this scenario out to customize the
  mock server functionality.


  Try sending a test request to `/todos`. This will return the mocked equivalent
  of `http://todos.stoplight.io/todos`.
