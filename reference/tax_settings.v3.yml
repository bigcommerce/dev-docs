          description: This setting applies only if a merchant enters tax-inclusive prices. When enabled, the store subtracts the itemʼs store tax rate before calculating tax using the shopperʼs tax zone. The tax-exclusive amount will be the same across all tax zones. When disabled, the tax-inclusive price remains the same across all tax zones; only the tax amount will vary based on the shopperʼs location. The tax-exclusive amount may vary among tax zones.

When enabled, the store identifies a country-level tax zone based on the geolocation of a guest shopper. The store then applies the corresponding tax zone to estimate taxes. When disabled, the store identifies the zone using the provided `guest_shopper_tax_zone_id` field instead. Only the tax zones you configure can be matched to the guest shopper's geolocation.

          description: ID for the tax zone a store uses when subtracting store tax. This setting applies only if a merchant enters tax-inclusive prices and subtracts store tax before tax calculation.
