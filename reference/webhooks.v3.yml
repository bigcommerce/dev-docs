        * a storefront shopper adds their first product to a cart during a new session
        * an application makes a successful `POST` request to `/carts` using either the [REST Storefront](/docs/rest-storefront/carts#create-a-cart) API or the [REST Management](/docs/rest-management/carts/carts-single#create-a-cart) API
        * a storefront makes a successful call to create a cart using the [GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/guide/graphql-storefront)

        Cart creation also fires the `store/cart/updated` webhook.

    store_cart_updated:

      description: |-
        Fires when one of the following occurs:
        * A cart's line items are modified by adding a new item to a cart, updating an existing item's quantity, or deleting an item.
        * A shopper enters or changes their email address during guest checkout. This includes signing in to a customer account after creating a guest cart, which associates the account's email address with the cart.

        The `store/cart/created` webhook firing also triggers this webhook because adding a product to an empty cart is considered an update. 

        Changes to the following fields trigger this event:

    store_cart_deleted:
      title: store/cart/deleted
      description: |-
        Fires when a cart is deleted. Carts are deleted in two ways; when all items are removed from a cart, and when an API consumer explicitly removes the cart using a `DELETE` request. Cart deletion ends the cart lifecycle. The `store/cart/updated` webhook also fires when the last item is removed.
