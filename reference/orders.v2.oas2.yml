    ## Order
    
    The Order object contains a record of the purchase agreement between a shopper and a merchant. To learn more about creating orders, see [Orders API Guide](/api-docs/orders/orders-api-overview).
    
    ### Currency Fields
    
    The **default** currency refers to the transactional currency which is the currency the shopper pays in.
    
    The **display** currency refers to the presentational currency used to present prices to the shopper on the storefront.
    
    * `currency_id` - the display currency ID. Depending on the currency selected, the value may be different from the transactional currency.
    * `currency_code` - the currency code of the display currency used to present prices to the shopper on the storefront. Depending on the currency selected, the value may be different from the transactional currency.
    * `currency_exchange_rate` - the exchange rate between the store’s default currency and the display currency. For orders created using the V2 endpoints, this value is always 1 (only in the storefront this value can be different to 1).
    * `default_currency_id` - the transactional currency ID.
    * `default_currency_code` - the currency code of the transactional currency the shopper pays in.
    
    The following additional fields are returned on orders when Multi-Currency is enabled on the store:
    
    * `store_default_currency_code` - the currency code of the store’s default currency.
    * `store_default_to_transactional_exchange_rate` - the exchange rate between the store’s default currency and the transactional currency used in the order.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```json
    {
      ...
      "currency_id": 4,
      "currency_code": "EUR",
      "currency_exchange_rate": 1,
      "default_currency_id": 4,
      "default_currency_code": "EUR",
      "store_default_currency_code": "USD",
      "store_default_to_transactional_exchange_rate": "100.0000000000"
      ...
    }

        Creates an *Order*. To learn more about creating or updating orders, see [Orders Overview](/api-docs/orders/orders-api-overview).

        Create an order with an existing catalog product or a custom product.

        **Required Fields**

        * `products` or `consignments`
        * `billing_address`

        When you create an order, the `consignment(s)` array allows you to create pickup consignments.
        - An order can have either a pickup or a shipping fulfillment method, but not both.
        - An order can have only one pickup consignment.

        Choose from one of the following:
        1. Create order with a shipping fulfillment method using `shipping_addresses` and `products`, i.e. legacy mode
        2. Create order with a pickup fulfillment method using `consignments`, i.e. Consignment mode

        You can fulfill an order with shipping or pickup, but not both.
        
        This means that if the `consignments` array is present in the request, then _none_ of the following may be present and vice-versa:
        - `shipping_addresses`
        - `products`

        Creates an *Order Shipment*. For more details, see [Shipping an Order](/api-docs/orders/orders-api-overview#creating-order-shipments).
        
        **Required Fields**
        *   order_address_id
        *   items
        
        **Usage notes**

        There are three methods for generating a tracking link for a shipment:

        1. Use `shipping_provider` and `tracking_number`: This generates an automatic tracking link that you can click from the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. The `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents this tracking link. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.

        2. Use `tracking_carrier` and `tracking_number`: This also creates an automatic tracking link that you can click in both the BigCommerce control panel and customer-facing emails. Like the previous method, the `generated_tracking_link` property in the API response represents this tracking link. The `tracking_link` property in the API response will remain empty.

        3. Supply a custom `tracking_link`: By providing a value for the `tracking_link` property, you can use your own tracking link within the BigCommerce control panel and in customer-facing emails. The API response will return your supplied tracking link as part of the `tracking_link` property in the response. In situations when there isn't a `generated_tracking_link`, the property in the API response will remain empty. 
        
        Acceptable values for `shipping_provider` include an empty string (`""`), `auspost`, `carrier_{your_carrier_id}` (only used if the carrier is a [third-party Shipping Provider](/api-docs/providers/shipping)), `canadapost`, `endicia`, `usps`, `fedex`, `royalmail`, `ups`, `upsready`, `upsonline`, or `shipperhq`.
        
        Acceptable values for `tracking_carrier` include an empty string (`""`) or one of the valid [tracking-carrier values](https://github.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/blob/master/assets/csv/tracking_carrier_values.csv).

        **Usage notes:**

        To `add` a custom product to an existing order, don't include `id` in the payload. You must provide a non-empty value for at least one of these fields: `name`, `name_customer`, or `name_merchant`.
        To `update` an order product line, `id` is required. The payload should only contain the fields that need to be updated. You cannot change omitted fields.

        Note the following constraints and default field values:
         - Empty strings `''` and `null` are invalid for `xxx`, `xxx_customer`, and `xxx_merchant`.
         - `name` and `name_customer` always hold the same value; updating either `name` or `name_customer` will change the value for both of those fields.
         - If both fields `name` and `name_customer` are present, they must have the same value.
         - When updating an existing order product, if you omit both fields `name` and `name_customer` from the request, they will not be updated.
         - When updating an existing order product, if you omit `name_merchant` from the request, it will not be updated.
         - When adding a product, if you omit `name_merchant`, it will be set to the value of `name` (or `name_customer`).
         - When adding a new product to an existing order, if you omit both fields `name` and `name_customer`, they will be set to the value of `name_merchant`.

         To `update` an order product line, `id` is required. The payload should only contain the fields that need to be updated. The fields that you omit will not be changed.

         - Empty strings `''` and `null` are invalid for `xxx`, `xxx_customer`, and `xxx_merchant`.
         - When updating an existing order product without changing the variant, product, or product options, requests that do not contain `xxx_merchant` will fail.
         - When updating an existing order product, requests that do not contain both fields `xxx` and `xxx_customer` will fail.
         - Empty strings `''` and `null` are invalid for `xxx`, `xxx_customer, and `xxx_merchant`. If `xxx_merchant` is omitted, it will default to have the catalog value.

        **Usage notes**

        Provide one of these fields with a non-empty value:
          - `name`
          - `name_customer`
          - `name_merchant`
        
        Note the following constraints and default field values:
          - Null and `''` empty strings are invalid for `name`, `name_customer`, and `name_merchant`.
          - `name` and `name_customer` always share the same value; updating one updates the other.
          - When you omit both `name` and `name_customer`, they default to the value of `name_merchant`. 
          - When you omit `name_merchant`, it defaults to the value that `name` and `name_customer` share.
