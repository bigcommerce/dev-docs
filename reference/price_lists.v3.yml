  title: Price Lists
  description: |-
    Populate different versions of catalog pricing and assign them to different [customer groups](/docs/rest-management/customers-v2/customer-groups) at the variant level.

    ## Price Lists
    You can associate a Price List with a customer group either through the control panel or by using the [Customer Groups API](/docs/rest-management/customers-v2/customer-groups).

    You can create [Price List Assignments](/docs/rest-management/price-lists/price-lists-assignments#create-price-list-assignments) to assign Price Lists to a specific [channel](/docs/rest-management/channels/channel-listings). Price Lists assigned to a channel apply to all shoppers on that channel, unless there are more specific assignments or customer group discounts set up for the shopper's customer group.

    If an active Price List does not contain prices for a variant, the catalog pricing will be used.
    Price Lists provide overridden price values to the Stencil storefront. You can further customize the final price display using Stencil's [handlebars objects](/docs/storefront/stencil/themes/context/object-reference/config).

    To learn more about Price Lists, see [Price Lists API](/docs/store-operations/pricing/price-lists).

    ## Price Lists Assignments

    ### Order of operations
    
    **IF** Price List assigned to current customer group **AND** Price List assigned to current channel:
    * Use this Price List -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)
    
    **ELSE IF** Price List assigned to current customer group:
    * Use this Price List -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)
    
    **ELSE IF** Customer group discounts:
    * Use them -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)
    
    **ELSE IF** Channel has a default Price List:
    * Use this Price List -- any prices not found fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)
    
    **ELSE**:
    * Fall back to the catalog price (or in the case of multi-currency, auto-converted prices)

    ## Usage notes

    - You cannot assign Price Lists to a customer group with customer group discounts -- You must delete the customer group discounts first.
    - Bulk pricing Tiers can additionally be associated with a price record to indicate different pricing as the quantity in the cart increases.
    - If a variant has a Price Record, any existing product-level bulk pricing will not apply to the cart. For variants without Price Records, any existing product bulk pricing will apply.
    - [Price Lists Records](/docs/rest-management/price-lists/price-lists-records) accepts bulk upsert. You can only do one bulk upsert at a time. Running more than one bulk upsert in parallel on the **same store** will cause a `429` error and the request will fail.
    - There are webhooks available for Price Lists assignments. The price list assignment webhook fires when a price list assignment is assigned, reassigned, or unassigned. Note that since Price Lists directly relate to products, neither product nor SKU webhooks are going to fire for corresponding changes, such as pricing.

        * Up to 2 concurrent batch upsert requests are supported with this API. Running more than the allowed concurrent requests in parallel on the **same store** will cause a `429` error, and your additional requests will fail. You are encouraged to run requests sequentially with as many records per request as possible to maximize performance.
        * When updating a product with variants, or multiple SKUs, don't include records for the parent product SKU.
