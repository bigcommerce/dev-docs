        This webhook is fired whenever a cart is modified through the changes in
        its line items. Eg. when a new item is added to a cart or an existing

        changed during guest checkout or an existing item is deleted. The
        payload will include the ID of the cart being updated.

        product being added to an empty cart triggers an update.

        did not exist before) For the API it means a POST to /carts, (V3 and
        Storefront API).

        This webhook is fired whenever a cart is modified through the changes in
        its line items. Eg. when a new item is added to a cart or an existing
        item’s quantity is updated. This hook also fires when the email is
        changed during guest checkout or an existing item is deleted. The
        payload will include the ID of the cart being updated.


        This webhook is also fired along with cart created, because the first
        product being added to an empty cart triggers an update.


        - Logging into customer account after creating a cart (email is
        inherited from customer account email).

        - Entering email address via guest checkout.

        - Changing the email in guest checkout.

  CallbackResponse:
    description: >-
      To acknowledge that you received the webhook without issue, your server
      should return a 200 HTTP status code. Any other information you return in
      the request headers or request body will be ignored. Any response code
      outside the 200 range, including 3_xx_ codes, will indicate to us that you
      did not receive the webhook. When a webhook is not received (for whatever
      reason), we will retry the callback as described below.
