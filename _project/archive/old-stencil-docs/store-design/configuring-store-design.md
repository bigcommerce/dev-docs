## Configuration Files

Each theme contains two related JSON files of key-value pairs: <span class="fn">config.json</span> and <span class="fn">schema.json.</span> These files' keys provide the following features:

* Keys that you include in <span class="fn">schema.json</span> – together with their corresponding <span class="fn">config.json</span> default values – define the settings that merchants can customize through Store Design's graphical interface.
Other <span class="fn">config.json</span> keys contain metadata about the theme, such as the theme's name, version, and resource controls.
* Keys located in <span class="fn">config.json</span>'s `variations` object define variations of the theme. For example, a theme might have a "Light" variation and a "Bold" variation, each with different typography and colors. Each theme can include as many variations as you like.
* Keys located under both files' `settings` objects define the theme's look, feel, and functionality.

For documentation on the principal keys included in Stencil's reference Cornerstone theme, see this section's [config.json Metadata](/stencil-docs/stencil-theme-editor/config-json-metadata) and [schema.json Metadata](/stencil-docs/stencil-theme-editor/schema-json-metadata) entries. For an introduction to the graphical editor, see
[Store Design Overview](/stencil-docs/stencil-theme-editor/stencil-theme-editor-overview).

## Managing Keys between Versions

To make sure revisions to your theme are backward-compatibile, we generally recommend that you manage keys in both your <span class="fn">config.json</span> and <span class="fn">schema.json</span> files in an additive way. Specific recommendations:

Adding new keys is generally fine. (However, each key in <span class="fn">schema.json</span> must have a matching default in <span class="fn">config.json</span>.)

* Use caution in deleting any key. Doing so can break your new theme version's backward compatibility.
* We do not recommend renaming keys. Instead, we recommend introducing a new key, while maintaining the old key until it is no longer in use by anyone using an older version of your theme.
* Each object within your <span class="fn">config.json</span> › `variations` object defines one theme variation. If you are adapting an existing theme and consciously want to remove one or more variations, you can do so by removing the corresponding key(s).

## Persistent Settings Storage

When store administrators use Store Design to customize your theme for their store, the store's resulting configuration settings are saved to a separate configuration service at BigCommerce.

## Theme Upgrades and Settings

When a merchant upgrades your theme to a newer version, all key-value pairs that were saved to the BigCommerce configuration service are carried forward. For example, assume this customization/upgrade scenario:

You release your Star Glow theme, version 1. This theme's <span class="fn">config.json</span> includes a key named `logo_size`, establishing a default value of 100x250. The combination of the key and the value compose a `logo_size` setting.
The merchant uses Store Design to change the `logo_size` setting to 175x275. This customized setting is stored in the BigCommerce configuration service.
You release Star Glow, version 1.1. In this theme revision, you have changed the `logo_size` to 300x300.
When the merchant applies Star Glow version 1.1 to their store, their custom `logo_size` setting of 175x275 remains in effect.
If the merchant creates a second store and applies Star Glow version 1.1 to it, that store has no custom `logo_size` setting – so it will default to the new theme version's 300x300 value.
