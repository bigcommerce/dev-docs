## Checking a Theme's Size

Your theme should ideally bundle into an archive of only a few megabytes. BigCommerce imposes a hard limit of 50 MB, but most themes do not approach this limit unless they include many large static assets.

If your theme is unlikely to exceed 50 MB, you can skip past jump directly to Bundling and Uploading a Theme.

A few themes, however, might exceed the 50 MB limit. In these cases, you can either Shrink Your Theme with the help of WebDAV or Stage Your Theme for CDN Delivery to restructure your theme to a size that's manageable for upload to BigCommerce.
