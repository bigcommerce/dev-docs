There are three editable invoices in BigCommerce:

1. [Email Invoice](/customizing_email)
2. [Merchant Printable Invoice](/customizing_merchant)
3. [Customer Printable Invoice](/customizing_customer)

Merchants commonly request developers modify the default content of invoices in order to satisfy specific business requirements and industry demands. In order to assist developers in making these changes, this articles contains instructions on how to edit each invoice.

## Customizing the Email Invoice Template

The email invoice is sent to a customer after an order has been completed. The email invoice can be edited in the Control Panel in `Storefront` > `Email Templates` > `invoice_email.html`

After clicking the `edit` button on the right, the WYSIWYG Editor will appear. Follow [Editing and Printing Invoices](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Invoices#custom) (Knowledge Base) to complete customization of the Invoice Email template.

## Customizing the Merchant Printable Invoice

The Merchant Printable Invoice is the invoice that can be printed from the control panel in `Orders` > `View`. Clicking the `...` in the Action column will generate a list of options, one option being `Print Invoice`.

The invoice that is generated by clicking Print Invoice relies on a template files and variables from [BigCommerce's legacy Blueprint](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/legacy/blueprint-themes/blueprint-email-templates) themes framework. This invoice can be customized by performing the following steps:

1. Download the [invoice_printable.zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/template-files/invoice_printable.zip) file, which contains the skeleton of a printable invoice.

2. Open the file in the text editor of your choice and edit the HTML file to match your desired customization.

## Customizing the Customer Printable Invoice

The customer printable invoice is the printable invoice that is available on a storefront’s order page for **shoppers that have registered accounts with your store**.

<!--
    title: 
    data: //s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1540377767108
-->

![](//s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6116/1540377767108 "")

This invoice becomes available in a shopper’s orders after completing an order. A shopper can generate this invoice by clicking `Print Invoice` on the right-hand side of the page.

As a developer, you can customize this invoice by editing your theme’s `invoice.html` file that is present in your theme's files. In Cornerstone, this file is located in `/cornerstone/templates/pages/account/orders/invoice.html`.
