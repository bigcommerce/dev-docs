The <span class="fp">config.json</span> file is used to configure your Stencil theme. Use to manage custom theme settings. 
The <span class="fp">config.json</span>file allows you to:
* Provide global context for Stencil’s CSS and Handlebars resources
* Set values for [Store Design](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Store-Design)
* Provide metadata for your theme’s listing in the Theme Marketplace
* Define variations included in your theme

## Requirements and Restrictions

Your theme's <span class="fp">config.json</span> file must meet the following requirements:

* It must be named <span class="fp">config.json</span>, must reside in the root of your `{theme-name}` top level subdirectory (e.g.: <span class="fp">/cornerstone/config.json</span> or <span class="fp">/stencil/config.json</span>), and must be valid JSON.
* The maximum allowable size for a theme's <span class="fn">config.json</span> file is 64 KB. Exceeding this limit will trigger an error upon uploading the theme to BigCommerce.
* Each key's value is restricted to 64 characters. Exceeding this limit will similarly trigger an upload error.
* Other than these size constraints, there is no limit on the number of keys and values that you can place in a theme's <span class="fn">config.json</span>.

### Carefully Check Your Requirements
> Carefully check your theme against all the requirements listed here – including the required keys within the `meta` object and `variations` array. While some requirements are not enforced in local development, they will be validated (and will trigger errors) when you later upload your theme to BigCommerce.
