## Restructuring Your Theme

In this section, you will first isolate static assets from your theme's local directory, then use WebDAV to cloud-host those assets, and finally reference those assets using Stencil's cdn Handlebars helper.
For an existing theme, make a backup of your whole <theme‑name> directory before proceeding.

Examine your theme's `/assets/` subdirectory and/or its intended contents. Check for large static assets like images (especially in `/assets/img/`) and videos that are likely culprits in causing a bundled `.zip` file to go toward or beyond BigCommerce's 50 MB limit.

Use WebDAV to upload these items to WebDAV's remote `/content/` directory. For WebDAV specifics, please see BigCommerce's Knowledge Base articles on:
* [Connecting to WebDav]()
* [WebDAV Folder Structure]()

Throughout your theme, reference each of these assets using Stencil's `cdn` custom Handlebars helper – prepending the `webdav:` option to the `assetPath` parameter.

Prepending `webdav:` will build a URL in the remote WebDAV directory. This allows your theme's deployed topology to diverge from any your local directory structure. As noted above, the `cdn` helper will treat `/content/` as the default/root WebDAV directory. So, for example, this statement:

`<img src="{{cdn "webdav:img/image.jpg"}}">`

will build the URL transformed below:

`<img src="https://cdn.bcapp/3dsf74g/content/img/image.jpg">`

On your local machine, move the large static assets to a location where the `stencil bundle` command will ignore them.
This can be a location outside your `<theme-name>` directory, or it can be the `<theme-name>/assets/cdn/ subdirectory`, which stencil bundle excludes from bundling. Separating these assets is necessary to exclude them from the next step.

Run or re-run the `stencil bundle` command, from inside your streamlined `<theme‑name>` directory.
Once your resulting `.zip` file is 50 MB or smaller, upload it to BigCommerce, as described [here]().

### URL References to Assets
> Both in production and locally, subdirectories of your theme's `assets/` directory – like `img/`,` js/`, and `fonts/` – are parallel to its `scss/` subdirectory. So within your CSS, path references to such assets should reflect this parallel relationship – for example: `../img/test.jpg`.

## WebDAV Folders and Stencil Themes

If you have used WebDAV in developing BigCommerce's earlier (Blueprint) generation of themes, you will see some differences when uploading Stencil themes.<br><br>

The directories accessible through WebDAV will dynamically change, depending on the type of theme that is active in the merchant's store, as follows:<p></p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Available while the merchant's active theme is Blueprint:</b></td>
    <td class=""><b>Available while the merchant's active
      theme is Stencil:</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/content/</td>
    <td>/content/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/product_images/</td>
    <td>/product_images/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/product_downloads/</td>
    <td>/product_downloads/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/import_files/</td>
    <td>/import_files/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/exports/</td>
    <td>/exports/</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/template/</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>/mobile_template/</td>
    <td>-</td>
  </tr>
 </table>

<i>The overall difference is that the WebDAV `/template/` and `/mobile_template/` directories are <b>not</b> available for Stencil themes. These templates must reside and remain within your Stencil theme's local directory and file structure.</i>
