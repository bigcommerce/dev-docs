Certain Stencil objects can be accessed through multiple other Stencil objects. For example, the image object is exposed through the Category, Product, Product Options, and other objects. Its structure is consistent for all objects/properties that access it. 

This consistent behavior is true for each of the common objects documented in the following subsection: 

 * [Catalog Price](/stencil-docs/stencil-object-model-reference/stencil-objects/common-objects/catalog-price)
 * [Price](/stencil-docs/stencil-object-model-reference/stencil-objects/common-objects/price)
 * [Price Range](/stencil-docs/stencil-object-model-reference/stencil-objects/common-objects/price-range)
 * [Stencil Image](/stencil-docs/stencil-object-model-reference/stencil-objects/common-objects/stencil-image)
 * [Common Product Card Model](/stencil-docs/stencil-object-model-reference/stencil-objects/common-objects/common-product-card-model)
