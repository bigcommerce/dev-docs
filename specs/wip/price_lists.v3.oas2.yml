  description: >
    The Price Lists resource allows you to populate different versions of a
    product's price by variant. You can then assign different prices to specific
    customer groups. 


    You can associate a price list with a customer group using the [Customer
    Groups resource](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api). 


    >**Note** 

    >

    >Customer group discounts must be deleted before assigning price lists to a
    customer group.

    ## Authentication

    Requests can be authenticated by sending a `client_id` and `access_token`
    via `X-Auth-Client` and `X-Auth-Token` HTTP headers:


    ```http

    GET /stores/{$$.env.store_hash}/v3/catalog/summary

    host: api.bigcommerce.com

    Accept: application/json

    X-Auth-Client: {client_id}

    X-Auth-Token: {access_token}

    ```


    You can obtain the `client_id` and `access_token` using either of the
    following methods:

    - [Creating API
    account](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#obtaining-store-api-credentials)

    - [Installing an app in the BigCommerce control
    panel](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#obtaining-app-api-credentials)

    ## OAuth Scopes

    Scope limits ability to read or modify data. To interact with the Price
    Lists resource, set the scope to the minimum level needed to accomplish your
    specific task. 


    | UI Name                                      | Permission |
    Parameter                                     |

    |----------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------|

    | Products                                     | modify     |
    `store_v2_products`                           |

    | Products                                     | read-only  |
    `store_v2_products_read_only`                 |


    For more information on OAuth Scopes, see
    [Authentication](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication).


    ## Subresources


    ### Assignments

    [Price List
    Assignments](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/price-lists/price-lists-records/)
    can be created to assign price lists to a specific
    [Channel](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/channels-listings-api).
    Price lists assigned to a channel apply to all shoppers on that channel,
    unless there is a more specific assignment.


    ### Records

    The Records resource returns details of the variants and pricing associated
    with a price list. You can associate [Bulk
    Pricing](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Bulk-Pricing) tiers with
    a price record as the quantity of products in a cart increases.


    Price Lists records accept [bulk upsert](#). 


    >**Note**

    >

    >Only one bulk upsert can done at a time. Running more than one in parallel
    on the **same store** will cause a `429` error, and the request will fail.
