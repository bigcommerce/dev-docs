# API Specifications
The Open API, Swagger, and JSON Schema files in this directory are used to generate [BigCommerce's API Reference documentation](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference).

## Recommended Editor
The recommended editor for OAS files is [Stoplight Studio Desktop](https://stoplight.io/studio/). Using the desktop version allows you to use Studio like you would any other code editor. This opens up using `git` from the command line (or git's GUI) instead of stoplight's built-in UI.

## Other Editors
You can also edit with your favorite code or OAS editor, then make a pull request.

Here are some popular OAS editors:
* [Apicurio Studio](https://studio.apicur.io/)
* [editor.swagger.io](https://editor.swagger.io/)
* [Apibldr](https://www.apibldr.com/)
