## Introduction

The Orders API is used when an order is being created manually. If you are using the Server to Server Checkout an Order can be created using the orders endpoint. The order can then be updated if needed.

A sample order workflow might include:
* Creating the order for either an existing customer or guest
* Taking payment using either the Control Panel or third party payment solutions
* Creating a shipment for the order to generate an order confirmation email and mark it as shipped

### Prerequisites:
**BigCommerce Store**  
An active BigCommerce store with a sellable [product](/api-reference/catalog/catalog-api/products/createproduct)

**Scopes**  
The following [OAuth](/api-docs/getting-started/authentication#authentication_oauth-scopes) scopes are required:
* Modify Orders

## Create an Order

We will go over adding an existing product, adding a custom product, adding a billing address and adding a shipping address. At the end of this section, you will be able to see the full sample request to create an order.

Want to skip ahead and see the [full request](/api-docs/orders/orders-api-overview#orders-api-overview_create-order-example)?

At a minimum, an order needs products and a billing address. If either of these fields are left off the order is rejected.

A order can be created with either an existing Product or using a Custom Product.

### Add an Existing Product with Options

**Required Fields:**
- product_id
- product_options (required if adding a product with variants)
	- product_option > id
	- product_option > value
- quantity
- price_inc_tax (optional)
- price_ex_tax (optional)

To get the `product_option > id` and `product_option > value`, make a request to [Get Variants](/api-reference/catalog/catalog-api/product-variants/getvariantsbyproductid). Variants will return the `option_value > id` and `option_values > option_id`.

Make note of the `option_values > id` and `option_values > option_id`. These will be passed into the products array.

**Example Variants Response**  
`/GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/catalog/products/{product_id}/variants`

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 421,
            "product_id": 184,

            "width": null,
            "height": null,
            "depth": null,
            "is_free_shipping": false,
            "fixed_cost_shipping_price": null,
            "purchasing_disabled": false,
            "purchasing_disabled_message": "",

            "upc": "",
            "mpn": "",
            "gtin": "",
            "inventory_level": 0,
            "inventory_warning_level": 0,
            "bin_picking_number": "",
            "option_values": [
                {
                    "id": 180,
                    "label": "Red",
                    "option_id": 200,
                    "option_display_name": "Color"
                },
                {
                    "id": 192,
                    "label": "Small",
                    "option_id": 230,
                    "option_display_name": "T-Shirt Size"
                }
            ]
        }
...
```

Next, create the products array which includes the custom product and the existing product with product options. Using the `option_id` and `option_value > id` from the previous request we can build the products array.

`product_options` > `id` = `option_values` > `option_id`

`product_options` > `value` = `option_values` > `id`

The `product_options` > `value` must be passed in as a string.

### Custom Products
> Creating a custom product does not add it to the catalog. Only to the current order.

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Order Products

**Pricing**

If price is not specified, it will automatically pick up the price from the store’s product catalog. However, you can override this via `price_inc_tax` and `price_ex_tax`.

If the `price_inc_tax` or `price_ex_tax` specified then any variant pricing is ignored and the order products base_price is updated according to the store settings. For example, if the store is set to display prices with tax included, then the `base_price` will be `price_inc_tax`.

**Stock**

For products that are configured to track stock, the quantity specified on the order will reduce the stock on hand. When there is not enough inventory to fulfill the order, the order will be rejected with an “out of stock” error code.

**Min and Max Quantities**

For products that have min and max quantities specified in their settings, the API will honor these, and will reject orders appropriately.

**Options**

For products where product options are required, the API will validate these requirements to ensure that the product options are specified.

**Customer File Uploads**

For products that allow customers to upload a file at checkout (i.e. an image uploaded for a t-shirt order), developers can follow these steps to retrieve the file:

* Get the filename value from GET [/orders/[order_id]/products](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/order-products/getallorderproducts), in the product_options array
* Use that filename value to download the file via WebDAV using the following path: https://store.com/product_images/configured_products/[value]

### Add a Billing Address

**Required Fields:**
* first_name
* last_name
* street_1
* city
* state
* zip
* country
* country_iso2
* email

### Add a Shipping Address - optional

**Required Fields:**
* first_name
* last_name
* street_1
* city
* state

            "phone": "",
            "email": "trish@testing.com"
        }
```

### Other Recommended Fields
Below are fields which are recommended but not required when creating an order.

**Customer ID**

The customer_id will determine the price the shopper pays for an item. Customer ID’s are tied to customer group discounts and Price Lists. Set the `customer_id` to 0 when creating a guest order.

**Shipping Address**

If a shipping address is not provided, it will default to the billing addresses provided.

**Status**

If a status is not provided, it defaults to a status of 1 or Pending.

**Discounts**

Manual discounts are supported. To add a manual discount either overwrite the product price or use `discount_amount`. This accepts a fixed dollar amount.

### Create Order Example

After the products, billing and shipping address are added, an order can be created.

* The order products sub-resource will list the products added.
* The shipping_addresses sub-resource will have the shipping addresses.
* The coupons sub-resource will have any coupons added to the order.

## Shipping an Order
We will go over creating a shipment for an order, shipping quotes, shipping carriers and shipping to multiple locations.

### Create an Order Shipment

**Required Fields:**
* order_address_id
* shipping_provider
* items

Once an Order has products, a billing address and at least one shipping address a order shipment can be created. Order shipments are a way to mark an order as shipped with the shipping information.

To get the `order_address_id`  use the ID returned in [Order Shipping Address](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/order-shipping-addresses/getallshippingaddresses).

The items array requires the product quantity and `order_product_id`. The `order_product_id` is the ID returned from [Order Products](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/order-products/getanorderproduct).

There does not need to be a shipping provider. If the shipping provider is not sent in at all, it will default to custom and a tracking link is not generated. To have the tracking link generated without a shipping provider, provide an empty string. To add a shipping provider, see the available options on [Order Shipment](/api-reference/orders/orders-api/models/ordershipment).

Once the order shipment is created, it will automatically send out an email to the billing address with the shipment confirmation. To stop this behavior adjust the [Order Notification](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Customer-Order-Notifications#enable) settings in the Control Panel.

If the order shipment is deleted, the status of the shipment is still in shipped. The status will need to be [manually changed](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/order-status/getaorderstatus).

### Multiple Locations

Orders can have multiple shipment locations. There needs to be more than one product or quantity of a product and more than one shipping addresses. A shipping address can be added either during the create or using an update.

To ship to multiple locations create an order shipment for each location and items. Only one POST request per shipment.

### Custom Quotes
An order can be created with a `shipping_cost_ex_tax` and `shipping_cost_inc_tax`. This is a way to add a custom shipping amount to an order. This can be added when creating or updating an order.

<!-- theme:  -->
### Shipping Cost
> Both `shipping_cost_ex_tax` and `shipping_cost_inc_tax` must be included otherwise, the final order amount will not be calculated correctly.

</div>

### Shipping Carrier
Generating a quote through a shipping carrier is currently not supported. A shipping carrier can be specified when creating an Order Shipment. The quote can be generate elsewhere, then update the `shipping_cost_ex_tax` and `shipping_cost_inc_tax` for the order total to be correct..

## Taxes
Tax will be calculated based on the tax rules specified in the store, except in the case of automatic taxes. However, in both cases, you can optionally override the tax values by specifying `price_inc_tax` and `price_ex_tax`.

If a store has automatic tax enabled, BigCommerce does not compute sales tax on orders created via the API.

### Avalara
When the store is subscribed to Avalara Premium, a value of API Tax Override is written to the Order Tax object’s name field.

Abbreviated state names in shipping and billing addresses will prevent tax documents from being submitted to Avalara. To ensure successful Avalara tax-document submission, spell state names out in full. For example, supplying CA as a state name leads to no tax-document submission. Supplying California as a state name leads to a successful submission.

POST or PUT orders on stores with Avalara Premium cause tax documents to be submitted. If a store has subscribed to Avalara Premium, BigCommerce automatically submits tax documents to Avalara when the order achieves a paid status. See Order Status below for a list of paid statuses.

You can create overrides for calculated values such as product prices, subtotal and totals by sending a fixed value in the request. If values are not supplied for these properties, they will be automatically calculated based on the preset store values and tax rules.

| Existing Status | Status Passed | Resultant Status | Avalara Tax Document Submission |
|-|-|-|  |
| Any | None | `Pending` | None |
| Paid or `Refunded` | Paid | Paid | None |
| Unpaid or `Refunded` | Unpaid | Unpaid | None |
| Paid or `Refunded` | Unpaid | Unpaid | Tax document voided |
| Unpaid or `Refunded` | Paid | Paid | Tax document submitted |

## Overriding Preset Values
You can create overrides for calculated values such as product prices, subtotal and totals by sending a fixed value in the request. If values are not supplied for these properties, they will be automatically calculated based on the preset store values and tax rules.

## Calculation of Totals
When not specified, order subtotal and total are automatically calculated.

You can override order subtotal and/or total. If you choose to override one, we strongly recommend that override both, because the system will not be able to accurately calculate the other.

Edits to the following properties will trigger a recalculation of the subtotal and total:

*   products
*   discount_amount
*   shipping_cost_ex_tax
*   shipping_cost_inc_tax
*   handling_cost_ex_tax
*   handling_cost_inc_tax
*   wrapping_cost_ex_tax
*   wrapping_cost_inc_tax
*   billing_address
*   shipping_addresses

## Order Status
When moving through order management, the order status is not automatically updated. This needs to be changed as needed.

You can specify `status_id`, which will automatically set the corresponding status. When `status_id` is not specified, it will be automatically set to 1, which will set status to Pending.

The following statuses are of the paid type:
* Shipped
* Partially Shipped
* Awaiting Pickup
* Awaiting Shipment
* Completed
* Awaiting Fulfillment

BigCommerce considers all statuses other than those above to be of the unpaid type, except Refunded, which is considered neither paid or unpaid.

### Custom Order Status

The order status label can be changed in the Control Panel. This **does not** change the underlying functionality. See our support article on [Order Status](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Order-Statuses#rename).

## FAQ

**Is adding coupons available?**

Coupon redemption is not currently supported. The `coupon_discount` field can not be written to. A discount can be added to the order by using the `discount_amount`.

**How do I create an order for a guest?**

To specify a guest checkout, set `customer_id` to 0.

**How do I set the order source?**

The `order_source` cannot be specified, and will be set to external. You can optionally specify a value for `external_source` to specify which external source the order is coming from - e.g., POS system X, accounting system Y, etc.

**Can I create an order with only custom products?**

Yes, the products are not added to the store's catalog.

**What is the difference between country_ISO2 and country?**

In the shipping and billing addresses, there is no requirement to specify country when `country_ISO2` is specified and vice versa.

**How can I take a payment for an Order?**
You can either process payment through a third party or using the Control Panel.

**Can I generate a shipping quote from a carrier using the API?**

Not at this time. If an order is created either in the Control Panel or via API, then it returns a 204 when trying to get a [Shipping Quote](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/models/shippingquotes).
