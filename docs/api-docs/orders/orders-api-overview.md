This article introduces BigCommerce's [Orders V2](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders) and [Orders V3](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions) REST API resources. [Orders V2](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders) exposes endpoints for [creating](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/orders/createanorder), [reading](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/orders/getallorders), [updating](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/orders/updateanorder), and [deleting](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/orders/deleteallorders) orders; it also includes endpoints for managing [order shipments](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipments) and [order shipping addresses](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses). [Orders V3](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions) surfaces [order transactions](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/transactions/gettransactions) and [order refunds](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions) endpoints. For information on processing order payments via API, see [Payments API Overview](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/payments/payments-api-overview).

## Adding products

Specify [products from the catalog](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses/updateashippingaddress#request-body) by including a [`products` array](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses/updateashippingaddress#request-body) in the [create order](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/orders/createanorder) request.

## Creating order shipments

Once an order has products, a billing address, and a shipping address, you can create an order shipment.

To [create an order shipment](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipments/createordershipments), send a `POST` request to `/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/orders/{{order_id}}/shipments`.

```http
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}}/v2/orders/{{order_id}}/shipments
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
X-Auth-Client: {{CLIENT_ID}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

      "order_product_id": 194,
      "quantity": 1
    },

      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

<div class="HubBlock-content">

> ### Note
> * Create multiple shipments by specifying a subset of products and quantities in each `POST` request.

## Shipping to multiple locations

You can create multiple shipments for orders, and each shipment can have a different `order_address_id`.

```http
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}}/v2/orders/{{order_id}}/shipments
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
X-Auth-Client: {{CLIENT_ID}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "order_address_id": "123",
  "shipping_provider": "usps",
  "items": [
    {
      "order_product_id": 2,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

```http
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}}/v2/orders/{{order_id}}/shipments
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "order_address_id": "456",
  "shipping_provider": "",
  "items": [
    {
      "order_product_id": 5,
      "quantity": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

[![Open in Request Runner](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/Open-Request-Runner.svg)](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipments/createordershipments#requestrunner)

|Property|Description|
|-|-|
|`order_address_id`|Obtainable via [Get Order Shipping Address](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses/getallshippingaddresses)|
|`shipping_provider`| Optional; used to create tracking link; see [Create Order Shipment](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipments/createordershipments) for accepted values|
|`items.order_product_id`|Obtainable via [Get Order Products](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-products/getallorderproducts)|

## Getting shipping quotes

To [get shipping quotes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses-quotes/getshippingquotes), send a `GET` request to `/v2/orders/{order_id}/shipping_addresses/{shipping_address_id}/shipping_quotes`.

```http
GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/orders/{order_id}/shipping_addresses/{shipping_address_id}/shipping_quotes
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
X-Auth-Client: {{CLIENT_ID}}
Accept: application/json
```

[![Open in Request Runner](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/Open-Request-Runner.svg)](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses-quotes/getshippingquotes#requestrunner)

**[Response:](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-shipping-addresses-quotes/getshippingquotes#responses)**

```json
{
  "id": "16",
  "uuid": "18aaa5eb-3c7a-4bf8-bfaa-d14d155606f1",
  "timestamp": "Mon, 30 Jul 2018 15:32:35 +0000",
  "shipping_provider_id": "bcproductbased",
  "shipping_provider_quote": [],
  "provider_code": "productfixedshipping",
  "carrier_code": "",
  "rate_code": "",
  "rate_id": ""
}
```

Generating a quote through a shipping carrier is not supported. You can specify a shipping carrier when creating an order shipment. You can generate the quote elsewhere, then update the `shipping_cost_ex_tax` and `shipping_cost_inc_tax` for the order total to be correct.

## Getting order taxes

To [get order taxes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-taxes/getordertaxes), send a `GET` request to `/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/orders/{order_id}/taxes`.

```http
GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v2/orders/{order_id}/taxes
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
X-Auth-Client: {{CLIENT_ID}}
Accept: application/json
```

[![Open in Request Runner](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/Open-Request-Runner.svg)](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-taxes/getordertaxes#requestrunner)

**[Response:](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-taxes/getordertaxes#responses)**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 13,
    "order_id": 138,
    "order_address_id": 39,
    "tax_rate_id": 1,
    "tax_class_id": 0,
    "name": "Tax",
    "class": "Default Tax Class",
    "rate": "8.0000",
    "priority": 0,
    "priority_amount": "17.6400",
    "line_amount": "17.6400"
  }
]
```

The response's [order tax object](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/order-taxes/getordertaxes) `name` property gets set to `API Tax Override` when generated by third-party tax services like [Avalara Premium](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/avalara-avatax/?search=avalara).

```json
[
  {
    "id": 13,
    "order_id": 138,
    "order_address_id": 39,
    "tax_rate_id": 1,
    "tax_class_id": 0,
    "name": "API Tax Override",
    ...
  }
]
```

BigCommerce submits tax documents to Avalara when an order moves from an **unpaid** status to a **paid** status and voids tax documents when an order moves from a **paid status** to an unpaid status.

| Existing Status | Status Passed | Resultant Status | Avalara Tax Document Submission |
| - | - | - | - |
| Any | None | `Pending` | None |
| Paid or `Refunded` | Paid | Paid | None |
| Unpaid or `Refunded` | Unpaid | Unpaid | None |
| Paid or `Refunded` | Unpaid | Unpaid | Tax document voided |
| Unpaid or `Refunded` | Paid | Paid | Tax document submitted |

<div class="HubBlock--callout">
<div class="CalloutBlock--info">
<div class="HubBlock-content">

> ### Note
> * Abbreviated state names (ex: `CA` instead of `California`) in an order address will cause tax document submission to fail.
> * Taxes are calculated using rules specified in the store (unless [automatic taxes](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Automatic-Tax-Setup) are enabled).
> * You can optionally override tax values by specifying `price_inc_tax` and `price_ex_tax` in an [update order request](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/orders/orders/updateanorder).
> * If a store has [automatic tax](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Automatic-Tax-Setup) enabled, BigCommerce does not compute sales tax on orders created via the API.

## Getting order transactions

To [get order transactions](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/transactions/gettransactions), send a `GET` request to `/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/orders/{order_id}/transactions`.

```http

## Handling refunds

[Orders V3](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions) exposes endpoints for managing [order refunds](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/order-transactions/order-refunds). For an overview on using these endpoints, see [Order Refunds in API Docs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/orders/payment-actions).

## Calculating totals

Order `subtotal` and `total` calculate automatically; edits to the following properties trigger recalculation.

|`handling_cost_ex_tax`|`float`|Value of handling cost, excluding tax|

|`billing_address`|`obj`|Used to calculate shipping and taxes| 
|`shipping_addresses`|`array[obj]`|Used to calculate shipping and taxes|

You can override calculated values such as product prices, subtotals, and totals by sending a fixed value in the request. If values are not supplied for these properties, they will be automatically calculated based on the preset store values and tax rules.

> ### Note
> * If you override `subtotal` or `total`, override both; the system will not re-calculate the other.
> * To add a manual discount, overwrite the product price or `discount_amount`.

## FAQ

**Is adding coupons available?**

Coupon redemption is unavailable. You can not write to the `coupon_discount` field. You can add a discount to the order by using the `discount_amount`.

**How do I create an order for a guest?**

To specify a guest checkout, set `customer_id` to 0.

**How do I set the order source?**

You cannot specify the `order_source`; its value is external. You can optionally specify a value for `external_source` to define which external source the order is coming from - e.g., POS system X, accounting system Y, etc.

**Can I create an order with only custom products?**

Yes, the store's catalog does not include products.

**What is the difference between country_ISO2 and country?**

There is no requirement to specify country when `country_ISO2` is specified in the shipping and billing addresses and vice versa.

**How can I take a payment for an order?**

You can either process payment through a third party or using the control panel.

**Can I generate a shipping quote from a carrier using the API?**

Not at this time. If an order is created either in the control panel or via API, it returns a 204 when trying to get a Shipping Quote.
