# End-to-End User Journey API Guide

This page is a how-to guide on creating end-to-end Buy Online Pickup In-Store (BOPIS) *customized* experiences for both merchants and shoppers through BigCommerceâ€™s APIs. This guide lays out the API calls in sequence, framed from the perspective of an end-to-end user journey.

## 1.0 Prerequisites
1. You create a new partner store and share the URL with (jordan.sim@bigcommerce) to activate BOPIS on your store (Note: this will be a non-transacting store, and should not be used to process live transactions)
2. Store settings have been configured (e.g. Payments, Shipping, Tax, Catalog, etc)
3. You are not using BigCommerce's defeault Checkout, but are using a custom checkout, i.e. 
      - You have installed a new custom checkout or you have an existing checkout built on the Checkout JS SDK or;
      - You have built a headless experience using the Server-to-Server (S2S) Checkout V3 APIs
4. OAuth scopes have been granted and configured on your store: 
      - Store Inventory
      - Store Locations
      - Pickup Methods
      - Order Fulfillment
5. Obtain [Store API Credentials](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#store-api-accounts) containing the required [OAuth scopes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#oauth-scopes).

## 2.0 Setup and configure as a merchant
### 2.1 Create a location

You start by first creating a location. Customers can pick up their orders from this location, i.e. a *pickup* location.

### 2.4 Manage inventory for a location

BigCommerceâ€™s Inventory API enables two ways of managing inventory quantities:
* **Absolute quantity** - the amount defined in the API payload is the inventory quantity that will be set for a product or variant.
* **Relative quantity** - the amount defined in the API payload will be added to (or subtracted from) the existing inventory quantity that already exists for the product or variant.

Before setting inventory quantity to a location, check the inventory tracking configurations that have been enabled. There are three inventory tracking configurations:
* **Inventory is tracked by product** - This setting is used if your product has no variations, e.g. a champagne glass or a water glass tumbler.
* **Inventory is tracked by variant** - This setting is used if your product has different attributes (variations), e.g. a shirt has various sizes and colors.
* **Inventory is not tracked** - This setting is used if you do not have a need to track inventory quantity, e.g. you may sell a digital asset (like a PDF or music). When inventory is not tracked, the product will always be considered available to sell on your storefront, even if it may not be in your physical storage location.

Itâ€™s important to know the type of tracking when making absolute or relative adjustments, as this will ultimately determine how you author your API request to set inventory quantity.

#### 2.4.1 Absolute adjustments to inventory quantity

### 2.5 Configure inventory settings

In addition to making absolute or relative adjustments to inventory quantities, other inventory settings can also be set, including:

- **Warning Level** - This is the same as the `inventory_warning_level` attribute in the Catalog API
- **Safety Stock** - The quantity of product that is stored to prevent an out-of-stock situation. It serves as insurance against sudden or rapid fluctuations in demand. Safety stock quantity is not included in the "available to sell" quantity that may be displayed to customers on the storefront.

You can configure inventory settings for inventory tracked by product.

### 2.7 [Optional step] Get a product's inventory across all locations

Alternatively, you may want to view inventory information for a product across all locations where that product is stocked. This can be achieved by filtering on the `product_id`, `variant_id` or `sku`.

## 3.0 Browse and discover as a shopper

There are two ways to access data on the storefront:
- Storefront REST API
- Storefront GraphQL API

Over time, BigCommerce will be investing more in the Storefront GraphQL API, so all future enhancements to support BOPIS will be made against the Storefront GraphQL API.

### 3.1 Storefront REST API

#### 3.1.1 Find available pickup options with stock available 

Use this to show pickup options to customers on a storefront page (e.g. the product detail page).

<!--

## 4.0 Manage checkout as a shopper
The Checkout SDK and Server-to-Server (S2S) Checkout APIs have been updated to support BOPIS experiences. As a developer, you may wonder which to choose and when to use the SDK vs the API. If youâ€™re developing:
* A native storefront and custom checkout experience, use the Checkout SDK
* An end-to-end headless experience, use the S2S Checkout APIs

If youâ€™re dependent on webhook events, all [existing Cart webhooks](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/store-management/webhooks/webhook-events) have been updated to support BOPIS.

### 4.1 Native storefront & custom checkout experience via Checkout SDK
To support BOPIS, we would be adding a `loadPickupOptions` method to the [CheckoutService](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js/blob/master/docs/classes/checkoutservice.md) class, allowing you to load pickup options to your storefront checkout. In order to fetch pickup-options via the Checkout SDK, you will need to be on SDK version 1.224.0 or above. This applies to existing custom checkouts as well as new custom checkouts. 

```JS title="Example JavaScript Code" lineNumbers
const consignmentId = '123';
const searchArea = {
  radius: {
    value: 1.4,
    unit: 'KM' // Another unit allowed here is 'MI'
  },
  coordinates: {
    latitude: 1.4,
    longitude: 0
  }
};

const query: PickupOptionRequestBody = { consignmentId, searchArea };

const state = await checkoutService.loadPickupOptions(query: PickupOptionRequestBody);

/*
* Pickup options are once fetched and then cached against the consignmentId and
* searchArea. So unless you change either of the parameters the options there wonâ€™t 
* be an API call to the server and memoized options will be returned to checkout App
*/

// To log and see pickup options
console.log(state.data.getPickupOptions(consignmentId, searchArea));
```

If you want to show pickup method options to customers on a storefront page (e.g. the Product Detail Page), before having a consignment, refer to [4.2.2 Find available pickup methods with stock available](#422-find-available-pickup-methods-with-stock-available).


### 4.2 End-to-end headless experience (S2S APIs)

#### 4.2.1 Create a cart with a product in it

<!--

```JSON title="Example request: Create a cart" lineNumbers

{
  "line_items": [
    {
      "quantity": 1,
      "product_id": 97
    }
  ]
}
``` 

<!--
type: tab

```JSON title="Example response: Create a cart" lineNumbers
{
  "data": {
    "id": "76f1bfe4-dbbe-4018-8ee6-2e3c36bf1518",
    â€¦
    "line_items": {
      "physical_items": [

        }
      ],

      "gift_certificates": [],
      "custom_items": []
    },
    â€¦
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

<!-- type: tab-end -->

For a successfully-created cart, the response will have:
* The newly-created cart ID. In this example, the cart ID is `76f1bfe4-dbbe-4018-8ee6-2e3c36bf1518`.
* The physical product ID. In this example, the cart ID is `67642f07-49d1-4501-8b7d-2e589aec34b8`.

Cart ID is the same as Checkout ID and both represent the same identifier for a cart depending on which API is being consumed: the Cart API uses cart ID and the Checkout API uses Checkout ID.

        }
        ...

    ]
    ...
  }
} 
```

<!-- type: tab-end -->

From the response we can see the consignment object now has a `selected_pickup_option` set with the `pickup_method_id` we requested.

Currently BOPIS only supports 1 consignment of type Pickup. If you attempt to mix pickup and shipping consignments or create multiple pickup consignments, you will receive an error message.

```JSON title="Example error response" lineNumbers
{
  "status": 422,
  "title": "Pickup method is limited to 1 consignment.",
  "type": "https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/api-status-codes"
}
```

If you have a change of mind, and you want to change it from pickup to be shipped, then you will need to update the consignment.

Storefront visibility is currently a shopper-facing property of a location. 
If it is set to false, then details about the location (e.g. description, operating hours) on the location details page and inventory quantities at that location will be excluded from the "available to sell" quantity on the storefront.
If it is set to true, then details about the location on the location details page and inventory quantities at that location will be included in the "available to sell" quantity on the storefront.
