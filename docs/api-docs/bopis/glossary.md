| ------------- | -------- |
| BOPIS | An acronym, commonly used in North America, that stands for "Buy Online Pick Up in Store". This is also known as "Click & Collect" within the APAC and UK/EU markets. |
| Consignment| Conceptually, consignment refers to a list of line items and information about how those items should be fulfilled and where they should be fulfilled from and to (i.e. transferred into the shopper’s hands), as captured during the checkout or order creation process. <br><br>  Specifically, this means a collection of store catalog item identifiers and their quantities along with information about the fulfillment, including the type (e.g. shipping or pickup) and details for that fulfilment type like a shipping destination address with a shipping origin location ID or a pickup location ID. <br><br>  A consignment captures the shopper’s (end customer's) intent towards how they'd like to receive their ordered products. A consignment does not represent how the merchant actually chooses to fulfill the shopper's order. |
| Location | Location is the newly introduced concept that allows merchants to track product inventory across multiple physical (or virtual) locations according to their needs. Furthermore, locations allow merchants to manage their store and warehouse physical addresses in a single source of truth which can be used by tools, such as storefront store locator widgets or any other app integrations that care about locations where a store’s business is conducted. |
| Pickup | Pickup is a new concept, analogous to shipments, which allows merchants to track and record order consignments that are ready to be picked up, and have already been picked up. The purpose is to help facilitate the merchant’s fulfillment workflows by allowing back office staff to manage orders with pickup consignments. |
| Pickup Method | Pickup method is a new concept, analogous to shipping methods, which allows merchants to customise the “pickup” options that can be shown in a checkout with an additional description and display text, beyond the basic address details given by the associated location. This concept allows merchants to set up multiple different pickup options for a single location, for example, in-store pickup or curbside pickup. |
| Routing | Routing refers to the process of determining which inventory locations to use as both inventory and fulfillment sources for line items within the cart, checkout and order. We believe there are two main approaches to routing: <br> - During the process of checkout (including the cart) <br> - After order creation then updating the order consignments with those details <br><br> Routing is not supported in the Beta. The intent is to perform further product discovery to identify relevant routing use cases and determine which will be supported. |
| Safety Stock | The quantity of product that is stored to prevent an out-of-stock situation. It serves as insurance against sudden/rapid fluctuations in demand. Safety stock quantity is not included in the available to sell quantity that may be displayed to customers on the storefront. |
| Warning Level | This is the same as the `inventory_warning_level` attribute in the Catalog API. |
