## Partner program
The BigCommerce Partner Program includes access to training, sales enablement, and a referral network to get more clients and build better ecommerce experiences.
Becoming an official BigCommerce partner will authorize you to provide best-of-breed solutions to the fast-growing online businesses we host. 


The following sections outline the steps required to publish single-click apps in the [BigCommerce App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps).


## Applying to the Technology Partner Program
Before you can submit an app to the BigCommerce App Marketplace, also known as the App Store, you must become an official partner. BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores through its Technology Partner Program. To be approved as a partner, you will need:

* A website showcasing your agency or technology solution
* Intent to offer your app publicly
* Ability to support your app's users
* Evidence of expertise in app development

For a list of general requirements and to verify that your application meets BigCommerce listing standards, see [App Store Approval Requirements](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/partner/app-store-approval-requirements).

The following steps outline how to become a BigCommerce Partner:

1. Go to the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/).
   
2. Click **Apply Today**.

5. Complete the member registration.
6. Click the **Complete Registration** button. 
7. Once your application is approved, check your email for your Partner ID.

Once approved, you will receive one or more emails listing your partner credentials and next steps. Your **Partner ID** will be required to submit your app for App Marketplace consideration. If you do not receive these credentials by email, please contact [appstore@bigcommerce.com](mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com).

## App Marketplace
To build and test a Marketplace app, you will need:

* A BigCommerce store (sandbox or trial)
* A developer account on the [BigCommerce Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps)
* BigCommerce partner credentials 

A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. 

We encourage you to create your sandbox store and your Developer Portal account using the same login credentials.

> **Note**
> Your Developer Portal account is an entirely separate account outside of the Partner Portal.

### Trials erased after 15 days
> Although you do not need a sandbox store for app development, it is best practice. If you opt to develop on a trial store, keep in mind the store and data will be erased after 15 days, and you will have to create a new trial store to proceed.

##  Troubleshooting

**Are all fields required when applying to become a partner?**

We highly recommend filling out all the fields associated with publishing edits for your listing. Without filling in all fields, your listing will lack information merchants are accustomed to seeing on other listings and expect to see throughout the Marketplace.


**I’ve logged into the Developer Portal, but I don’t see my published listing. Where is it?**

You may be logged in with the wrong account. Each listing can only be owned by one user, so it is likely assigned to another email address. If you’re unable to track down the correct owner account for your solution, please reach out to <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.

**Why can't I see the updates I've made to my App Marketplace listing?**


The updates will be effective immediately in your control panel app card, but the updates can take up to 24 hours to appear on the public BigCommerce Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace period to make additional edits as needed.


**Who should I contact if I have further questions?**

If you have additional questions, email <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.
