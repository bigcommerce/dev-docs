At BigCommerce, we strive to offer the best ecommerce experience to our customers. Occasionally we make updates to our platform to improve performance, add new features, or fix bugs. This article provides general information on how to stay current with latest changes. 

## General updates

For up-to-date information about latest releases, new features, and bug fixes, we recommend setting up [a feed alert](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/changelog#feeds) for the [Developer Changelog](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/changelog). Additionally, you can gain more visibility into product updates by attending BigCommerceâ€™s [Town Hall](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-Town-Halls) webinar programs and reading the [Product Blog](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/blog).

## Cornerstone theme updates

For recent updates to the Stencil's Cornerstone theme, we recommend setting up [a feed alert](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/changelog#feeds) for the [Developer Changelog](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/changelog). You can also refer to the [Cornerstone repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/) in GitHub.

Most of the time, you will not need to do anything to update your theme. New code is pushed to all stores several times a week. Occasionally, you may have to take some action by opting into the new feature in the control panel.

### Custom themes

Depending on the level of customization, you may need to manually port changes into your custom theme. The [Theme Updates and Version Control](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/deploying-a-theme/theme-updates-and-version-control) article talks about the steps you can take to keep your custom theme up-to-date with BigCommerce theme updates and version releases. To learn more about customization and applying updates, see [Apply Updates](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/developing-further/updates).

## API updates

To keep up with API changes, we recommend setting up [a feed alert](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/changelog#feeds) for the [Developer Changelog](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/changelog).

As BigCommerce continues to deprecate V2 API endpoints and operations, consider migrating your store to the V3 API to take advantage of new features and improved performance. For more information on V3 improvements and to learn about the differences between the V2 and V3 APIs, see [Difference between V2 and V3 Catalog REST APIs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/store-management/catalog/v2-vs-v3). For a comparison of major V2 and V3 operations, see [V2 to V3 Catalog Operations Comparison](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/store-management/catalog/v2-v3-examples). For planned deprecations and sunsets, refer to [Deprecations and Sunsets](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/deprecations-and-sunsets).

### Open betas

Our [Product Blog](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/blog) is the best place to learn about the upcoming open betas. 

## Checkout SDK updates

The Checkout JavaScript SDK and associated documentation is available from the [Checkout SDK repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js) in GitHub. Additionally, enterprise clients can reach out to their account manager to review services and resources available.
