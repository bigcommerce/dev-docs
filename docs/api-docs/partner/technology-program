## Program overview
Join the BigCommerce Partner Program to become an official BigCommerce partner. As an official partner, you will have access to training, sales enablement, and a referral network to get more clients and build better ecommerce experiences.

For instructions on how to apply, review the Partner Program [application requirements](#application-requirements).

## Application requirements
Only official partners can submit an app to the BigCommerce App Marketplace, also known as the App store. BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores through its Partner Program. To be approved as a partner, you will need the following:

* A website showcasing your agency or technology solution
* Intent to offer your app publicly
* Ability to support your app's users
* Evidence of expertise in app development

For a list of general requirements and to verify that your application meets BigCommerce listing standards, see [App Store Approval Requirements](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/partner/app-store-approval-requirements).

How to apply:
1. Go to the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/).
   
2. Click **Apply Today**.

5. Complete the member registration.
6. Click the **Complete Registration** button. 
7. Once your application is approved, check your email for your Partner ID.


Once approved, you will receive one or more emails listing your partner credentials and next steps. Your Partner ID will be required to submit your app for App Marketplace consideration. If you do not receive these credentials by email, please contact [appstore@bigcommerce.com](mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com).

## App Marketplace
To build a Marketplace app, you will need:

* A sandbox store
* A developer account on the [BigCommerce Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps)
* BigCommerce partner credentials 

We encourage you to create your sandbox store and your Dev Tools account using the same login credentials. A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. 

> **Note**
> Your Developer Portal account is an entirely separate account outside of the Partner Portal.

### Trials erased after 15 days
> Although you do not need a sandbox store for app development, it is best practice. If you opt to develop on a trial store, keep in mind the store and data will be erased after 15 days, and you will have to create a new trial store to proceed.

### Creating a sandbox store

1. Go to the [BigCommerce Pricing](https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/pricing/) page and select **Start your free trial**.

2. When prompted for an email address, enter the _same_ email you used when applying to become a partner.

3. In the trial store setup form, enter a store name, password, and other details. Then select **Create your store**.

4. Log into your Partner account to access the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com). 

5. Navigate to **Support > Contact Support** and select **Create a Support Case**.

6. While completing the form, use "Partner Sandbox" as the subject line. In the case description, enter your new sandbox store's canonical URL (for example: http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com) and request conversion to a sandbox. 

7. Under **Issue Type**, select **Merchant Account Services**. Click **Create Case**. We will flag this new trial store as a sandbox to ensure your store access continues beyond the 15-day trial period. This process can take several days.

8.  Log into your new trial store using the same email associated with your partner login.

### Marketplace apps
Merchants often have more than one person who can access a store's control panel. BigCommerce allows additional users to access an app when the store owner has granted them appropriate permissions. The requirements for supporting multi-user app access are:

* Tokens must be stored against the `store_hash` and not against user info.
* Within the [Dev Tools](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication/rest-api-authentication#obtaining-app-api-credentials) workspace, you must enable your app's **Technical** > **Multiple Users** option.

In the payload returned when a user launches an app, users are distinguished by `owner_email` versus `user_email`. If these two emails match, the user is the store owner.

If you wish to enable user removal, you can do by filling in your app's **Technical** > **Remove User Callback URL** field in Dev Tools. Enabling user removal is optional. For more advanced implementations, you can enable the store owner to grant specific permissions to different non-admin users. For example, `person1@email.com` could be restricted to only editing product inventory but not viewing orders. If you decide to include user permission in your app, it’s a great feature to advertise.

For more information, see [Multi-User Support](/api-docs/apps/guide/intro#multi-user-support).

## Troubleshooting

**Are all fields required when applying to become a partner?**

We highly recommend filling out all the fields associated with publishing edits for your listing. Without filling in all fields, your listing will lack information merchants are accustomed to seeing on other listings and expect to see throughout the Marketplace.


**I’ve logged into Dev Tools, but I don’t see my published listing. Where is it?**

You may be logged in with the wrong account. Each listing can only be owned by one user, so it is likely assigned to another email address. If you’re unable to track down the correct owner account for your solution, please reach out to <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.

**Why can't I see the updates I've made to my App Marketplace listing?**


The updates will be effective immediately in your control panel app card, but the updates can take up to 24 hours to appear on the public BigCommerce Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace period to make additional edits as needed.


**Who should I contact if I have further questions?**

If you have additional questions, email <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.
