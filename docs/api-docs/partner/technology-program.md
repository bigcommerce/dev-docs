## Program overview
Join the BigCommerce Partner Program to become an official BigCommerce partner. As an official partner, you will have access to training, sales enablement, and a referral network to get more clients and build better ecommerce experiences.

For instructions on how to apply, review the Partner Program [application requirements](#application-requirements).

## Application requirements
Only official partners can submit an app to the BigCommerce App Marketplace, also known as the App store. BigCommerce offers app developers free sandbox stores through its Partner Program. To be approved as a partner, you will need the following:

* A website showcasing your agency or technology solution
* Intent to offer your app publicly
* Ability to support your app's users
* Evidence of expertise in app development

For a list of general requirements and to verify that your application meets BigCommerce listing standards, see [App Store Approval Requirements](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/partner/app-store-approval-requirements).

How to apply:
1. Go to the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/).
   
2. Click **Apply Today**.

5. Complete the member registration.
6. Click the **Complete Registration** button. 
7. Once your application is approved, check your email for your Partner ID.


Once approved, you will receive one or more emails listing your partner credentials and next steps. Your Partner ID will be required to submit your app for App Marketplace consideration. If you do not receive these credentials by email, please contact [appstore@bigcommerce.com](mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com).

## App Marketplace
To build a Marketplace app, you will need:

* A sandbox store
* A developer account on the [BigCommerce Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps)
* BigCommerce partner credentials 

We encourage you to create your sandbox store and your Dev Tools account using the same login credentials. A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. 

> **Note**
> Your Developer Portal account is an entirely separate account outside of the Partner Portal.

### Trials erased after 15 days
> Although you do not need a sandbox store for app development, it is best practice. If you opt to develop on a trial store, keep in mind the store and data will be erased after 15 days, and you will have to create a new trial store to proceed.
