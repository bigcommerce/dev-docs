Dev Tools is the BigCommerce workspace for developing single-click apps. Within Dev Tools, you'll create the Client Id and Client Secret to authenticate your apps, submit new apps to the App Marketplace, and manage existing Marketplace listings.

Dev Tools can be found by clicking [My Apps](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) in the upper right corner of the page.

The requirements to submit an app are listed below, as well as where the information needs to be updated.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you’ve applied and been approved for our [Technology Partner Program](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/register_email.aspx) before you’re ready to submit your app - you’ll need a valid Partner ID to do so. You’ll also need to accept the Terms & Conditions in the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/) before we can publish your app.

## General Requirements
- Make Support resources available throughout the app experience (for example onboarding flow and app dashboard).
- Follow BigCommerce branding guidelines when referencing BigCommerce (see our [Media Kit](https://www.bigcommerce.com/press/media-kit/) for more information).
- Apps and listing must not reference competitor platforms.
- Brand name used in App submission should match the app's title used in app content.
- Keep app titles concise -- refrain from using extra taglines or descriptors (include those in the app summary, if necessary).
- Apps that connect to third-party service should include the name of the service and the company in the title (Ex: "Marketplace by BigCommerce", "Search by BigCommerce").
- App client-side code (including any storefront components) should be compatible with all [BigCommerce supported browsers](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Themes-Supported-Browsers).

## Functionality

-   Your app must work as intended, be free of defects, and not conflict with or break any default BigCommerce functionality, including the BigCommerce storefront and checkout.
-   Utilize any V3 API resources that are currently available for the data you need from a BigCommerce store.
-   The dashboard and callback URLs for your app should operate strictly over HTTPS using a valid SSL certificate.
-   Apps should offer [multi-user support](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#building-apps_multi-user-support) so that permissions for the app can be distributed by the store owner to additional users, from the BigCommerce control panel.
-   Any apps that process transactions or handle credit card data will need to pass a PCI Compliance review with our Security team, and also be compatible with our Optimized One-Page Checkout.
-   Avoid copy/paste for storefront code - use the [Scripts API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/storefront/content-scripts-api) to programmatically inject code snippets into a store’s Script Manager and storefront theme.
-   If your app requires payment, you’ll need to collect payment from the user within your app. See Pricing & Categorization under App Summary for more information.

## Installation

-   Apps should be Single-Click and use our OAuth token exchange flow to authenticate the user
-   Single-Click does not mean everything  completed in one click, but that authentication is handled in that click - other tasks can be handled post-auth with the user
-   When the app is installed, a styled HTML page must be returned in the iframe of the BigCommerce control panel - this content cannot be blank and must follow our [user-interface constraints](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#building-apps_user-interface-constraints).
-   During the OAuth handshake, be sure to store the user’s token against their store hash - rather than their email address - to avoid any problems with ownership changes or multi-user support.

### Meeting the requirements
> If your app cannot meet these requirements, please reach out to <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a> in order to discuss the potential for a Connector app listing. In the majority of cases, a Single-Click app will be the more appropriate solution and put your integration on par with other Marketplace partners, but exceptions may be made under certain circumstances

## Recommendations

-   Have a form to fill out for new users? We recommend auto-filling user input fields with data from the [Store Information API resource](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/store-information-api), which already contains much of the info you might need from a new user.
-   No account approval process needed for your app? Consider automatically generating accounts for stores that install your app and don’t match an existing store in your database.
-   Require login on launch? Use the information in the BigCommerce payload to your callback URL to authenticate the user without asking for a username and password each time.
-   Want to share user testimonials? Add a link to your full case study in the Case Studies field, with a title and short description.

## Dev Tools Walkthrough

Below are the screens you will go through when submitting an app through DevTools. Each tab shows the page along with the fields and descriptions. Each field needs to have the correct information for the app to be approved.

 
<a id="app-store-approval-requirements_app_summary"></a>

## App Summary

![App Summary](https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6012/1536259683439)

### Contact Name
Use the email address that was created when applying for your Partner Id.

### Partner Name
List the name of your company​, as you want it to be attributed on the detail page.

### Partner Website
Provide the URL for your homepage so users can learn more about your company.

### Support email
Email where users can get help with the app. This should be a formal group email at your company domain (Ex: support@app-partner.com) rather than a personal email. If not provided, this option will not be displayed.

### Support website
A Support email and website for users to reach out as needed.
These will be publicly visible on the Marketplace, so make sure to stay away from personal emails or non-support URLs. Your public detail page will include a button for users to “Get Support,” which will take them to this URL in a new tab. If not provided, the button will not be displayed on your detail page.

###  Partner ID
When you’re ready to submit your listing for review, you will need to enter your [Partner ID](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/register_email.aspx) for your Technology Partner account. This field is not required to create, save, or edit a Draft prior to submission.

![App Summary Part Two](https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6012/1536259722234)

### App Name
Use the brand name you’ve given your app for your app title throughout your app content. This listing name should be a concise title for easy identification and should not include additional taglines or descriptors. The name will always appear alongside your summary, so there’s no need to muddy your app’s branding with duplicate content when that tagline is already displayed with it.

#### Pricing & Categorization
Select one of our pre-formatted pricing options to call out your app’s starting price. If you offer a forever-free plan, choose the “Free” option. If your app does not fit one of our formatted options, specify your details in a few words in the “Other” selection.
- If you need to specify more detail on your pricing options, save it for your app description.  
Choose the most appropriate category for your app.

<div class="CalloutBlock--info">
<div class="HubBlock-content">

<!-- theme: info -->

### Connector Apps
> If your solution is a connector to a specific third-party service, or you’re offering only a particular feature, make sure to include both the name of the third party service or feature and your company name​ (Ex: “Marketplace by BigCommerce,” “Search by BigCommerce”). The company name needs to follow the feature.

## Details

![Details](https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6012/1536260365610)

### App Details
A more in-depth value proposition for your listing, including how your solution works, why your solution stands out in its category, and why a merchant should choose you over other competitors. Avoid using fluff or buzzwords, as this field will not be indexed for search. 200 words max recommended.

### Videos
Include videos that highlight the purpose and value of your solution. Select the video hosting platform (YouTube or Vimeo) and enter the video ID.

#### Video Best Practices

**YouTube**

## Technical

![Dev Tools Technical](https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6012/1536260547856)

### Multiple Users

By default, your app will only be accessible to the store owner (i.e., the user who created the store). Optionally, you can allow your app to be accessible to other store users. Consider the following before enabling [multi-user support](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#multi-user-support):

- Once you enable multi-user support, a store admin will still need to grant access to other users from within the store control panel. For each user account, there are settings that grant access to specific apps.

- Your app should be aware that when it receives the [Load Callback](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests), the user information passed in might not be the store owner’s. You’ll need to determine how to respond if you see a different user. For example, you may want to provision a new user account in order to personalize the experience.

- You can optionally specify a [Remove User Callback URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests) to receive a callback when a store admin revokes a user’s access.

### App Type

Select the type of app. We recommend [Single Click Apps](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/types-of-apps#single-click-apps) although some qualify to [Connector Apps.](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/types-of-apps#connector)

### Callback URLS

You must have an [Auth Callback URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#installation-update-sequence) and a [Load Callback URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#installation-update-sequence) to register your app.

#### Public URIs Required before Submission

Because the Auth Callback URI and Load Callback URI requests originate from the browser and not from BigCommerce, you can use non–publicly-available URIs and a self-signed certificate for a quick start. However, you must switch to – and test your app with – a publicly available Auth Callback URI and Load Callback URI before submitting your app for consideration in the App Marketplace.

If you want to receive a callback when the store owner uninstalls your app, you can provide an [Uninstall Callback URI](/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#load-uninstall-removal-requests).

![Dev Tool OAuth Scopes](https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6012/1536260600336)

### OAuth Scopes
If you know the [OAuth scopes](/api-docs/getting-started/authentication#authentication_oauth-scopes) that your app requires, you should select these. If you do not yet know the scopes that you need, you can just request minimal permissions (such as Information: Read-Only) to get started. However, once you determine the scopes you need, you must:
- Modify the scopes of your app in My Apps and save the changes.
- Obtain the new OAuth token during the [App Installation or Update flow](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api/#app-installation-and-update-sequence).
- Retest your app to make sure it still functions properly with the new token.

![Dev Tools App Testing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6012/1536260650757)
Add in any instructions needed to test the app thoroughly.

## Review

![Dev Tools Review](https://s3.amazonaws.com/user-content.stoplight.io/6012/1536260677950)
