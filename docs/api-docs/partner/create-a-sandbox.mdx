# Create a Sandbox Store

Sandbox stores are intended for developing and testing apps. They cannot process any live transactions.

This article walks you through the steps of creating a sandbox store and explains how to open a support case if you encounter any issues.

## Creating a sandbox store

To create a sandbox store, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to the [BigCommerce Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/) and sign in using your credentials.
2. After signing in, hover over **Create New** in the top navigation, then select one of the following two options:
   * To register a new deal and create an associated sandbox, select **Deal Registration** and consult the following instructions to [create a Deal Registration sandbox](#deal-registration-sandbox).
   * To create a sandbox for your own general use, select **Partner Use Sandbox** and consult the following instructions to [create a Partner Sandbox](#partner-use-sandbox).

## Accessing and managing partner sandboxes

Allow up to 15 minutes for the new store to appear in any list of stores.

The email that contains the sandbox credentials is sent only once. However, you can access the sandbox by signing in to the [BigCommerce account](https://login.bigcommerce.com/accounts/list) that uses the same email address as your Partner Portal account.

To review and manage your sandbox and trial stores in the Partner Portal, hover over **Reporting** in the top navigation, then click **Review Sandboxes & Trials**.
