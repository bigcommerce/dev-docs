# Building Point-of-Sale Channels

This article documents how to use [Channels Toolkit](/api-docs/channels/guide/channels-toolkit-reference) to install a POS channel into [Channel Manager](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Selling-Everywhere-with-Channel-Manager) during a [single-click app's](/api-docs/apps/guide/types) installation. We'll assume you're an experienced app and POS developer familiar with channels on BigCommerce.

### Prerequisites


- [Familiarity with channels on BigCommerce](/api-docs/channels/guide/overview)
- [Experience building apps](/api-docs/apps/guide/intro)
- Experience building POS integrations

## Creating a channel

After receiving the [POST response](/api-docs/apps/guide/auth#receiving-the-post-response) at the end of the single-click app OAuth flow, create a channel on the merchant's store. This allows merchants to import sales from the POS system and configure settings. To create a POS channel, set `type` to `pos` in the [create a channel](/docs/rest-management/channels#create-a-channel) request.

```http filename="Example request: Create a channel" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/channels
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "name": "Sample POS",
  "type": "pos",
  "platform": "custom",
  "external_id": "",
  "status": "connected",
  "is_listable_from_ui": true,
  "is_visible": true,
  "config_meta": {
    "app": {
      "id": 112233,
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "Overview",
          "query_path": "overview"
        },
        {
          "title": "Import",
          "query_path": "import"
        },
        {
          "title": "Settings",
          "query_path": "settings"
        },
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

[View reference documentation for this request](/docs/rest-management/channels#create-a-channel).

<Callout type="info">
  You can [find an app's ID](/api-docs/apps/tutorials/id) in the URL when editing the app in the [Developer Portal](/api-docs/apps/guide/developer-portal).
</Callout>


## Specifying the platform

Specify the POS system by assigning an [accepted value for `platform`](#accepted-values) in the [create channel request](/docs/rest-management/channels#create-a-channel).

```http filename="Example request: Create a channel" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/channels
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "name": "Sample POS",
  "type": "pos",
  "platform": "custom",
  ...
  }
}
```

### Accepted values

See the list of [Channels Platform types](/docs/rest-management/channels#platform) in the Channels API reference. You can use any platform with `pos` as an accepted type.

## Configuring UI sections

Define and configure the channel's UI tabs displayed in the control panel by passing in a `config_meta` object.

```http filename="Example request: Create a channel" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/channels
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "name": "Sample POS",
  ...
  "config_meta": {
    "app": {
      "id": 112233,
      "sections": [
        {
          "title": "Overview",
          "query_path": "overview"
        },
        {
          "title": "Import",
          "query_path": "import"
        },
        {
          "title": "Settings",
          "query_path": "settings"
        },
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Rendering UI sections

Use the `query_path` value passed to the app's control panel iFrame to render the corresponding UI section.
