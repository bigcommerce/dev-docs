A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. 

This article will walk you through the steps of creating a sandbox store.

## Creating a sandbox store

1. Go to the [BigCommerce Pricing](https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/pricing/) page and select **Start your free trial**.
2. When prompted for an email address, enter the same email you used when applying to become a partner.
3. In the trial store setup form, enter a store name, password, and other details. Then select **Create your store**.
4. Log into your Partner account to access the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com). 
5. Navigate to **Support > Contact Support** and select **Create a Support Case**.
6. While completing the form, use "Partner Sandbox" as the subject line. In the case description, enter your new sandbox storeâ€™s canonical URL (for example: http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com) and request conversion to a sandbox. 
7. Under **Issue Type**, select **Merchant Account Services**. Click **Create Case**. We will flag this new trial store as a sandbox to ensure your store access continues beyond the 15-day trial period. This process can take several days.
8.  Log into your new trial store using the same email associated with your partner login.
