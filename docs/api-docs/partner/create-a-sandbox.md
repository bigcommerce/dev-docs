This article walks you through the steps of creating a sandbox store.

## Getting a sandbox store

To build a Marketplace app, you will need:

* A sandbox store
* A developer account on the [BigCommerce Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps)

* BigCommerce partner credentials 

We encourage you to create your sandbox store and your Dev Tools account using the same login credentials. A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. 

> **Note**
> Your Developer Portal account is an entirely separate account outside of the Partner Portal.

### Trials erased after 15 days
> Although you do not need a sandbox store for app development, it is best practice. If you opt to develop on a trial store, keep in mind the store and data will be erased after 15 days, and you will have to create a new trial store to proceed.

## Creating a sandbox store

1. Go to the [BigCommerce Pricing](https://www.bigcommerce.com/essentials/pricing/) page and select **Start your free trial**.
2. When prompted for an email address, enter the same email you used when applying to become a partner.
3. In the trial store setup form, enter a store name, password, and other details. Then select **Create your store**.
4. Log into your Partner account to access the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com). 
5. Navigate to **Support > Contact Support** and select **Create a Support Case**.
6. While completing the form, use "Partner Sandbox" as the subject line. In the case description, enter your new sandbox storeâ€™s canonical URL (for example: http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com) and request conversion to a sandbox. 
7. Under **Issue Type**, select **Merchant Account Services**. Click **Create Case**. We will flag this new trial store as a sandbox to ensure your store access continues beyond the 15-day trial period. This process can take several days.
8.  Log into your new trial store using the same email associated with your partner login.
