# Create a Sandbox Store

 

A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. 

This article will walk you through the steps of creating a sandbox store.

## Creating a sandbox store

1. Go to the [BigCommerce Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/)) and log in using your login credentials.
2. After logging in, select the **Create New** tab in the navigation bar, and select an option:
    * **Deal Registration w/store**: select this option to create a sandbox with a deal registration.
    * **Partner Use Sandbox**: select this option to create a sandbox for your own internal use.
    * There is also a **Deal Registration** option; however, you cannot request sandboxes using this option.
3. If you select **Deal Registration w/ Store**, complete all fields in the **Create a Store/Register a Deal** page to create a sandbox.
    * In the **Create a Store** field, select **Partner Sandbox** or **30 Day Trial**.
    * After completing all fields, click **Submit**.

After submitting the sandbox trial with deal registration, you can track your deal's progress in the **Deal Registration & Manage Stores Dashboard**. Please allow up to 15 minutes for the new store/trial to appear in these lists.

You will also receive two emails: a Deal Registration Confirmation email, and your new sandbox/trial Store Login Credentials email, containing the login credentials to your sandbox/trial.


6. In the trial store setup form, enter a store name, password, and other details. Then select **Create your store**.
7. Log into your Partner account to access the [Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com). 
8. Navigate to **Support > Contact Support** and select **Create a Support Case**.
9. Select the type of issue you have (Product Support or Billing Support).
10. Select **Yes** to the question "Is this related to a specific store?"
11. While completing the form, use "Partner Sandbox" as the subject line. In the case description, enter your new sandbox storeâ€™s canonical URL (for example: http://your-store-name.mybigcommerce.com) and request conversion to a sandbox. 
12. Under **Issue Type**, select **Merchant Account Services**. Click **Create Case**. We will flag this new trial store as a sandbox to ensure your store access continues beyond the 15-day trial period. This process can take several days.
13.  Log into your new trial store using the same email associated with your partner login.
