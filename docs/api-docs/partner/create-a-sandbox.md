# Create a Sandbox or Trial Store

 A sandbox store cannot process transactions and is for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. 

This article walks you through the steps of creating a sandbox store and provides steps to make a support case if you have any issues..

## Creating a sandbox or trial store

1. Go to the [BigCommerce Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/) and log in using your login credentials.
2. After logging in, select the **Create New** tab in the navigation bar, and select an option:
    * **Deal Registration w/store**: select this option to create a sandbox with a deal registration.
    * **Partner Use Sandbox**: select this option to create a sandbox for your own internal use.
    * There is also a **Deal Registration** option; however, you cannot request sandboxes using this option.
3. If you select **Deal Registration w/ Store**, complete all fields in the **Create a Store/Register a Deal** page to create a sandbox.
    * In the **Create a Store** field, select **Partner Sandbox** or **30 Day Trial**.
    * After completing all fields, click **Submit**.

After submitting the sandbox trial with deal registration, you can track your deal's progress in the **Deal Registration & Manage Stores Dashboard**. Please allow up to 15 minutes for the new store/trial to appear in these lists.

You will also receive two emails: a Deal Registration Confirmation email, and your new sandbox/trial Store Login Credentials email, containing the login credentials to your sandbox/trial.

Upon creation of the first sandbox/trial, you will receive login credentials - this email is sent only once. You will be able to see all related stores by logging into your account here.
After your sandbox/trial is created, it can be viewed in the **Review and Manage Sandbox & Trials** Dashboard, accessed at **Reporting > Review Sandboxes & Trials** within the Partner Portal.


4. If you select **Partner Use Sandbox**, complete all fields in the **Create a Partner Sandbox** and click **Submit**.

After you submit the sandbox request, you will receive a new sandbox Store Login Credentials email, containing the login credentials to your sandbox. Your sandbox can also be viewed in the **Review and Manage Sandbox & Trials** Dashboard, accessed at **Reporting > Review Sandboxes & Trials** within the Partner Portal. Please allow up to 15 minutes for the new store/trial to appear in these lists. 

## Creating a support case
