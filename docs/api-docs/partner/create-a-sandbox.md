# Create a Sandbox or Trial Store

A sandbox store is intended for developing and testing apps without the 15-day time limit of a trial store. It cannot process any transactions.

This article walks you through the steps of creating a sandbox or trial store and explains how to open a support case if you encounter any issues.

## Creating a sandbox or trial store

**To create a sandbox or trial store**

1. Go to the [BigCommerce Partner Portal](https://partners.bigcommerce.com/English/) and sign in using your credentials.
2. After signing in, click **Create New**, and select an option:
    * **Deal Registration w/store**: select this option to create a sandbox with a deal registration.
    * **Partner Use Sandbox**: select this option to create a sandbox for your own internal use.
    * **Deal Registration**: select this option to create a deal registraion. Note that you cannot request sandboxes using this option.
3. If you select **Deal Registration w/ Store**, complete all fields in the **Create a Store/Register a Deal** page to create a sandbox.
    * In the **Create a Store** field, select **Partner Sandbox** or **30 Day Trial**.
    * After completing all fields, click **Submit**.

After submitting the registration for **Deal Registration w/Store**, you can track your deal's progress in the **Review Deal Registrations** page. Allow up to 15 minutes for the new store/trial to appear in these lists.

You will receive two emails: a Deal Registration Confirmation email, and your new sandbox/trial Store Login Credentials email, containing the login credentials to your sandbox/trial.

After creating the first sandbox/trial, you will receive an email with the login credentials - this email is sent only once. You can view all your related stores by signing into your account with these credentials.

After your sandbox/trial is created, you can view it and access your sandbox by navigating to **Reporting > Review Sandboxes & Trials** on the Partner Portal.


4. If you select **Create New** > **Partner Use Sandbox**, complete the **Sandbox Name** field in the **Create a Partner Sandbox** and click **Submit**.

After you submit the sandbox request, you will receive an email containing the login credentials for your new sandbox. You can view and access your sandbox by navigating to **Reporting > Review Sandboxes & Trials** on the Partner Portal. Allow up to 15 minutes for the new store/trial to appear in these lists.
