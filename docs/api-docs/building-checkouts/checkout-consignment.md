This article discusses how to create and update a consignment.

## Overview
A _consignment_ is a list of physical products that will travel together to the purchaser, and it specifies how those items can and will ship. It is an object that includes at least one product line item and one shipping address. A checkout containing one or more physical products will always have at least one consignment associated with it. An order that ships to multiple addresses will have at least one consignment per shipping address.

The Storefront Checkout and Server-to-Server Checkout APIs provide methods for creating consignments, which are shipments waiting to happen.  A newly created consignment returns a list of fulfillment options available based on the destination address.  These APIs also provide methods for updating this consignment to change the destination, add or remove items, and select a fulfillment option. 

A checkout containing physical products is not eligible to become an order until each of its consignments contains a `selected_shipping_option`.

### OAuth scopes

Use the following OAuth scopes for the Server-to-Server Checkout API.

| UI Name  | Permission | Parameter                     |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------|
| Checkouts | read-only  | `store_checkout_read_only`    |
| Checkouts | modify     | `store_checkout`              |

For more information on OAuth Scopes and authentication, see [Authentication](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/authentication).

NOTE: The Storefront Checkout API allows developers to build a checkout experience by accessing raw API request/response data.


### Limits
* 50 line item limit for guests shoppers
* 600 line item limit for logged-in shoppers


NOTE: BigCommerce Server-to-Server Checkout API responds quickly when only one consignment is present on the checkout; however, as you add more and more consignments to the order, the API calls take more and more time to complete.	


## Creating a consignment

Before creating a consignment, you need the checkout ID. The cart ID and checkout ID are the same.

There are two steps to create a new consignment.

1. To add a consignment to a checkout, append `include=consignment.available_shipping_options` to the POST request.

Below is an example `POST` request for creating two simple consignments.
  
  ```http
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/checkouts/{checkoutId}/consignments?include=consignments.available_shipping_options
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

  [
    {
      "shipping_address": {
        "email": "jane2@example.com",
        "country_code": "US",
        "first_name": "BigCommerce",
        "last_name": "Cart/Checkout",
        "address1": "123 Main Street",
        "city": "Austin",
        "state_or_province": "Texas",
        "state_or_province_code": "TX",
        "postal_code": "78751",
        "phone": "688546",
        "custom_fields": [
          {
            "field_id": "field_25",
            "field_value": "Great!"
          }
        ]
      },
      "line_items": [
        {
          "item_id": "00a8e1c3-996f-4786-96ca-2a8a887b6648",
          "quantity": 1
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "shipping_address": {
        "email": "testing@example.com",
        "country_code": "US",
        "first_name": "Testing",
        "last_name": "BigCommerce",
        "company": "BigCommerce",
        "address1": "111 Main Street",
        "address2": "#1324",
        "city": "Austin",
        "state_or_province": "Texas",

        "custom_fields": [

            "field_id": "field_25",
            "field_value": "You're Welcome"
          }
        ]
      },
      "line_items": [
        {
          "item_id": "00a8e1c3-996f-4786-96ca-2a8a887b6648",
          "quantity": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

## Updating a consignment

Before updating a consignment, you need the checkoutID and the consignmentID. You can find the consignmentID in the consignment object displayed in the response generated in step 1. The checkoutID is the same as the Cart ID.


The following is an example `PUT` request that updates a consignmentâ€™s `shipping_option_id` with one of the `available_shipping_options.id` returned in the response from the [Create a consignment endpoint](/api-reference/storefront/checkouts/checkout-consignments/checkoutsconsignmentsbycheckoutidpost).

  ```http
PUT https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/checkouts/{checkoutId}/consignments/{consignmentId}
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "shipping_option_id": "9241669174884c2f2e83b3adabf03f83"
}

```
