The store log tracks events that take place in your store. The store log is comprised of the **system log** and the **staff action log**. 

The Store Logs V3 API lets you retrieve your store's **system log**. The **system log** tracks events that take place on your storefront, including shipping quote requests, newsletter sign-ups, and more. Each event creates an entry in the system log that includes the event type, summary, reporter (module), severity, and creation date and time. You can retrieve only entries that have occurred within the past 365 days. 

This article guides API users on how to get entries for a store's **system logs**. This article shows users how to filter the response for various aspects of the entry, including event type, date created, and more.
