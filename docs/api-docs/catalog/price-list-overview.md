## What is a Price List?

A Price List allows you to populate different versions of catalog pricing and assign them to different [Customer Groups](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api). The prices are specified exclusively at the variant level.

If an active Price List does not contain prices for a variant then the Catalog pricing will be used. The association of a Price List to a Customer Group can be done either via the Control Panel or using the [Customer Groups API.](/api-reference/customer-subscribers/customers-api)

Price Lists will provide overridden price values to the Stencil storefront. Final price display can be further customized within the Stencil template. See the [Price Object](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/reference-docs/global-objects-and-properties) in Stencil for further documentation.

### OAuth Scopes
The following OAuth Scopes are required:
* [Products](/api-docs/getting-started/basics/authentication#authentication_oauth-scopes)

## Price List Definitions

- `Price List` -- A collection of price records. `Price Records` make up a price list.

- `Price Record` --  A price override for a particular variant - minimally, this is a variant ID, price, and currency.

```json
	{
		"variant_id": 3121,
		"price": 10.0,
		"sale_price": 8.0,
		"retail_price": 12.0,
		"map_price": 6.0,
		"currency": "EUR"
	}
```


- `PriceRecordBatch`: A way to update several `Price Records` in a `Price List` at once. Using this bulk upsert endpoint, you can upsert up to 1000 Price Records in a single API call.

- `Currency`:  A `Price List` can contain records for multiple currencies. At this time, *only price records that match the store's default currency will be used to determine storefront and in-cart prices.* Although BigCommerce supports a storefront currency selection, this is not currently integrated with Price Lists and will merely convert prices from the store's default currency for display convenience.

**Example Get All Price Lists**
`/GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/pricelists`

```json
[{
  "variant_id": 3121,
  "price": 10.0,
  "sale_price": 8.0,
  "retail_price": 12.0,
  "map_price": 6.0,
  "currency": "USD"
}, {
  "variant_id": 3255,
  "price": 11.0,
  "sale_price": 9.0,
  "retail_price": 13.0,

**Example Price List Assigned to a Customer Group**
`https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v2/customer_groups/{customer_group_id}`

```json
[

    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Price List Test",
        "is_default": false,
        "category_access": {
            "type": "all"
        },
        "discount_rules": [
            {
                "type": "price_list",
                "price_list_id": 1
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Under `discount_rules` the `type` is set to `price_list` and the `price_list_id` is 1. Which is the id of the price list the group has been assigned to.

## Price List Assignments
Price List Assignment can be made to assign a Price List to a specific sales Channel. This association lets you define custom pricing for shoppers only on a specific external site or platform. Price List Assignments can be combined with a Customer Group assignment to more specifically target logged in customers shopping on that Channel.

See [Channels, Sites and Routes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/channels-listings-api) for further documentation.

**Example Price List Assigned to Channel**
`https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v2/pricelists/assignments`

```js
{
  "customer_group_id": 3,
  "price_list_id": 2,
  "channel_id": 1
}

```


## Price List Notes

- Bulk Pricing Tiers may additionally be associated with a Price Record to indicate different pricing as the quantity in cart increases.

- If a variant has a `Price Record` any existing product-level bulk pricing will not apply in the cart.  For variants without `Price Records`, any existing product bulk pricing will apply.

- Price Lists Records accepts bulk upsert. Only one [Bulk upsert](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/catalog/pricelists-api/price-lists-records/setpricelistrecordcollection) can done at a time. Running more than one in parallel on the **same store** will cause a 429 error and the request will fail.
