## Configuring the Store

Before enabling Multi-Currency settings, make sure the store is configured as follows:
* Manual Taxes (or Avalara)
* Stripe Payment Gateway
* Stencil Theme
* Optimized One-Page Checkout

Additionally, review the [Currency API reference](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/currency-api) to get aquainted with the endpoints and resources related to configuring multiple currencies.

## Configuring Currencies

Transactional currencies can't be created via API just yet, so they'll need to be added via the control panel. To do so:

 1. Navigate to **Store Setup > Currencies**, then select **Add a Currency...**
 2. Enter a **Currency Name**
 3. Select an option for **Exchange Rate** (enter the exchange rate manually, or get exchange rate from BigCommerce's Currency Service)
 4. Check **Set as transactional currency?** if shoppers will transact in this currency -- if this box is not selected, it will be a display only currency.
 5. Configure **Currency Display** fields with desired settings, then
 6. Click **Save**.

After saving, be sure to check **visible** to make the currency visible to shoppers:

### Note
> Do not change the default currency -- this will cause unintented currency conversion issues.
