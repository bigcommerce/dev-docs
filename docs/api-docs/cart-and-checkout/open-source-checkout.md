You can create unique shopping experiences that fit with the look and feel of a store's brand using custom checkouts. This article will outline how to package a custom checkout file, and then install a custom checkout via the control panel.

This article will address using both [Open Source Checkout](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-js) and [Checkout SDK](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js) powered checkouts.

## Obtaining the JavaScript loader file
Custom checkouts must have a single JS loader file. The first step to using a custom checkout is generating this file. The loader file must be responsible for the following:

* Loading all the required assets, including CSS files
* Running the app

### Packaging custom checkouts with Open Source Checkout

If using Open Source Checkout, you can generate the loader file by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the folder where Open Source Checkout is located using the terminal, and run `npm ci` to download dependancies
2. Run `npm run build` to generate a `/dist/` folder with all the files

When using Open Source Checkout to view changes and test implementations through the UI, deploy and install the custom checkout. More details are below.

### Properties available on checkout page
When a store is using custom checkout, some properties will be attached to the window object (`window.checkoutConfig`) on the checkout page. These properties are:

* `containerId`: ID of the HTML component where the checkout app should be loaded.
* `orderId`: if present, it means we should render an order confirmation page for the given order Id
* `checkoutId`: if present, the ID of the active checkout. You cant have both orderId and checkoutId

To use the data exposed in the window object, include relevant code in your loader file. Here is an example of this code :

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Checkout checkoutId={ window.checkoutConfig.checkoutId } />,
  document.getElementById(window.checkoutConfig.containerId)
);
```

## Hosting a custom checkout

You will need to host the custom checkout file online so it can be served by the store. You can use a hosting service such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Using an external host will allow you the freedom to automate the build process if you wish and push updates automatically from your local machine.

### Using WebDAV to host a custom checkout

You can upload a custom checkout to your store's server using WebDAV. The instructions to upload the `/dist` folder to the BigCommerce server using WebDav are below:

1. Before proceeding ensure you have downloaded [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), our recommended WebDAV client.
**Note:**  For more information on how to use Cyberduck, refer to the [File Access (WebDAV)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV) page.
2. From your store control panel, navigate to **Server Settings** > **File Access (WebDAV)**.
    *  To automatically connect with Cyberduck, see [Single-click Login](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#login).
    *  To manually connect with Cyberduck, see [Connecting with Cyberduck Manually](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#manual).
3. From Cyberduck, enter the `/content` folder and create a new folder named *checkout*.
4. Navigate into the `/dist` folder in your checkout project.
5. Copy the contents of the `/dist` folder and paste it into the checkout folder.

## Installing custom checkouts  

To install a custom checkout on a store, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Advanced Settings > Checkout** in your store's control panel.
2. Under **Checkout Type**, select **Custom Checkouts**.
3. Type the following in the **Script URL** field, replacing <version> with the latest version number generated by running the `npm run release` command:
  ```
  `webdav:checkout/auto-loader-<version>.js`
  ```
  Prepending `webdav:` Indicates that the URL is in the remote WebDAV directory. It will treat `/content` as the root WebDAV directory.
  
  ![custom-checkout-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/custom-checkout-01.png "Custom Checkout")
 
4. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
5. Navigate to your live storefront to view your new custom checkout.
