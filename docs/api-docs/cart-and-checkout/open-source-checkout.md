# Installing a Custom Checkout

You can create unique shopping experiences that fit the look and feel of a store's brand using custom checkouts. This article will outline how to package a custom checkout file, and install a custom checkout via the control panel.

This article will address using both [Open Source Checkout](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-js) and [Checkout SDK](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js) powered checkouts.

## Obtaining the JavaScript loader file
Custom checkouts must have a single JS loader file. The first step to using a custom checkout is generating this file. The loader file must be responsible for the following:

* Loading all the required assets, including all CSS files no matter the location
* Running the app

## Developing a custom checkout

If you wish to customize a checkout, follow the steps below:

1. Please get in touch with support to prevent the CSS of default checkout from overriding the CSS of custom checkout. 
2. Enter your CSS into the [optimized-checkout.scss](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/assets/scss/optimized-checkout.scss) in Cornerstone or the [scss folder](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-js/tree/master/src/scss) in checkout.js. We suggest moving content from "optimized-checkout.scss to the scss folder or vice-versa to ensure there is a single source of truth for handling styles. NOTE: "optimized-checkout.scss" will always override the CSS rules defined in checkout-js.

### Packaging custom checkouts with Open Source Checkout

If using Open Source Checkout, you can generate the loader file by following these steps:

1. Navigate and locate the Open Source Checkout folder using the terminal, and run `npm ci` to download dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to generate a `/dist/` folder with all the files

When using Open Source Checkout to view changes and test implementations through the UI, deploy, and install the custom checkout. More details are below.

### Properties available on the checkout page
When a store uses custom checkout, some properties are attached to the `window.checkoutConfig` object on the checkout page. These properties are:

* `containerId`: ID of the HTML component where you load the checkout app.
* `orderId`: If present, it means we should render an order confirmation page for the given order ID.
* `checkoutId`: If present, the ID of the active checkout. You can't have both `orderId` and `checkoutId`.
* `publicPath`: If present, the public URL of the custom checkout file's directory.

To use the data exposed in the window object, include relevant code in your loader file. Here is an example of this code :

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Checkout checkoutId={ window.checkoutConfig.checkoutId } />,
  document.getElementById(window.checkoutConfig.containerId)
);
```

## Hosting a custom checkout

You will need to host the custom checkout file online so it can be served by the store. You can use a hosting service, such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Using an external host will allow you the freedom to automate the build process if you wish and push updates automatically from your local machine.

### Using WebDAV to host a custom checkout

You can upload a custom checkout to your store's server using WebDAV. The instructions to upload the `/dist` folder to the BigCommerce server using WebDav are below:

1. Before proceeding, ensure you have downloaded [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), our recommended WebDAV client. For more information on how to use Cyberduck, refer to the [File Access (WebDAV)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV) page.
2. From your active MSF-enabled store control panel, navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **File access (WebDAV)**.
    - To automatically connect with Cyberduck, see [Single-click Login](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#login).
    - To manually connect with Cyberduck, see [Connecting with Cyberduck Manually](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#manual).
3. From Cyberduck, enter the `/content` folder and create a new folder named *checkout*.
4. Navigate into the `/dist` folder in your checkout project.
5. Copy the contents of the `/dist` folder and paste it into the checkout folder.

## Installing custom checkouts  

You can install a custom checkout on a store in the following two ways:

* [Install using the control panel](#install-using-the-control-panel)
* [Install using the V3 Checkout API](#install-using-the-V3-checkout-API)


### Install using the control panel
To install a custom checkout on a store, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Checkout** in your active MSF-enabled store's control panel.
2. Under **Checkout Type**, select **Custom Checkouts**.
3. Type the following in the **Script URL** field, replacing <version> with the latest version number generated by running the `npm run release:alpha` command:
  ```
  webdav:checkout/auto-loader-<version>.js
  ```
  NOTES:
  
  *Prepending `webdav:` Indicates that the URL is in the remote WebDAV directory. It will treat `/content` as the root WebDAV directory.
  
  *It is important to include `<version>` number in the Script URL field. Because if you make changes to the same provided loader filename, you could serve a cached version to the user.
  
  ![custom-checkout-01](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/custom-checkout-01.png "Custom Checkout")
 
4. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
5. Navigate to your live storefront to view your new custom checkout.

### Install using the V3 Checkout API

To install a custom checkout on a store, use the [Update Checkout Settings](/api-reference/store-management/checkouts/checkout-settings/updatecheckoutsettings) endpoint to install the loader file.
