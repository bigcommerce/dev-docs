You can engage with your customers after purchase with a custom order confirmation page. This article outlines how to package a custom order confirmation file, and install a custom confirmation file via the control panel.
The installation process is the same as [Installing a Custom Checkout](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/customizing-checkout/installing-custom-checkouts), except you will modify a different [file](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-js/blob/master/src/app/order/OrderConfirmation.tsx) in [Open Source Checkout](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-js).

## Generate the JavaScript loader file
Generating a loader file is the first step in installing a custom order confirmation page. If you are creating a custom checkout and a custom order confirmation page using checkout-js, the generated loader file is the same for both. However, you can install a custom order confirmation page and still use the default checkout.

The loader file must be responsible for the following:

* Loading all the required assets, including CSS files
* Running the app

### Packaging custom order confirmation page with Open Source Checkout

If using Open Source Checkout, you can generate the loader file by following these steps:

1. Navigate and locate the Open Source Checkout folder using the terminal, and run `npm ci` to download dependencies
2. Run `npm run build` to generate a `/dist/` folder with all the files

When using Open Source Checkout to view changes and test implementations through the UI, deploy, and install the custom confirmation page. More details are below.

### Properties available on the custom order confirmation page
When a store uses a custom confirmation page, some properties are attached to the `window.checkoutConfig` object on the checkout page. These properties are:

* `containerId`: ID of the HTML component where you load the checkout app.
* `orderId`: if present, it means we should render an order confirmation page for the given order Id
* `checkoutId`: If present, the ID of the active checkout. You can't have both `orderId` and `checkoutId`

To use the data exposed in the window object, include relevant code in your loader file. Here is an example of this code :

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <OrderConfirmation orderId={ window.checkoutConfig.orderId } />,
  document.getElementById(window.checkoutConfig.containerId)
);
```

## Hosting a custom order confirmation page

You will need to host the custom confirmation file online so it can be served by the store. You can use a hosting service, such as [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/). Using an external host will allow you the freedom to automate the build process if you wish and push updates automatically from your local machine.

### Using WebDAV to host a custom order confirmation page

You can upload a custom order confirmation page to your store's server using WebDAV. The instructions to upload the `/dist` folder to the BigCommerce server using WebDav are below:

1. Before proceeding, ensure you have downloaded [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), our recommended WebDAV client.
**Note:**  For more information on how to use Cyberduck, refer to the [File Access (WebDAV)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV) page.
2. From your store control panel, navigate to **Server Settings** > **File Access (WebDAV)**.
    - To automatically connect with Cyberduck, see [Single-click Login](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#login).
    - To manually connect with Cyberduck, see [Connecting with Cyberduck Manually](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#manual).
3. From Cyberduck, enter the `/content` folder and create a new folder named *OrderConfirmation*.
4. Navigate into the `/dist` folder in your OrderConfirmation project.
5. Copy the contents of the `/dist` folder and paste it into the *OrderConfirmation* folder.

## Installing a custom order confirmation page  

To install a custom order confirmation page on a store, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Advanced Settings > Checkout** in your store's control panel.
2. Under **Custom Order Confirmation**, type the following in the **Script URL** field, replacing <version> with the latest version number generated by running the `npm run release:alpha` command:
  ```
  `webdav:checkout/auto-loader-<version>.js`
  ```
  NOTES:
  
  *Prepending `webdav:` Indicates that the URL is in the remote WebDAV directory. It will treat `/content` as the root WebDAV directory.
  
  *It is important to include `<version>` number in the Script URL field. Because if you make changes to the same provided loader filename, you could serve a cached version to the user.

4. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
5. Navigate to your live storefront to view your new custom order confirmation page.
