# Embedded Checkout

Embedded Checkout lets you place BigCommerce’s Optimized One-Page checkout onto an external site. This tutorial will walk you through the sequence of API calls your application should make to create a working Embedded Checkout.

This article assumes you have familiarity with the following concepts:

* Creating and managing a server-side application
* Making and receiving API calls from within your app
* Using your application to make changes to a front end

### Prerequisites

* Store API credentials with the following permissions.
	- **Carts:** `Modify`
	- **Channel Settings:** `Modify`
	- **Sites & Routes:** `Modify`
	- **Products:** `Read Only`

For more information, see [OAuth Scopes](/api-docs/getting-started/api-accounts#oauth-scopes).

* The [BigCommerce JS Checkout SDK](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-sdk-js) must be accessible in the browser.

## Creating a channel

To allow an external website to serve the BigCommerce checkout, create a new channel by sending a `POST` request to the `/channels` endpoint.

**`POST`** `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/channels`

**Create a Channel POST request**

```json showLineNumbers copy
{
    "type": "storefront",
    "platform": "custom",
    "name": "https://{your-site}.com"
}
```

The response will contain an `id` which we will use as the `channel_id` in future requests.

**Create Channel response**

```json showLineNumbers copy

{
    "data": {
        "id": 20266,
        "name": "https://www.{your-site}.com",
        "platform": "custom",
        "type": "storefront",
        "date_created": "2019-09-18T22:28:36Z",
        "date_modified": "2019-09-18T22:28:36Z",
        "external_id": "",
        "is_enabled": true
    },
    "meta": {}
}
```
<Callout type="info">
  Channels created via API are visible in the BigCommerce store's Control Panel in **Products** > **Listed On**. The Orders section will now also include a filter for your channel.
</Callout>



## Creating a site

Next, create a site for the channel by sending a `POST` request to the `/channels/id/site` endpoint.

**`POST`** `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/channels/{{channel_id}}/site`

**Create Site POST**

```js showLineNumbers copy
{
    "channel_id": 20266,
    "url": "https://www.{your-site}.com"
}
```

This returns `id` which you will use as the `site_id` in future requests. The `url` value is the base path for all other routes you define for the site.

**Create Site response**

```js showLineNumbers copy
{
    {
    "data": {
        "id": 6,
        "url": "https://www.{your-site}.com",
        "channel_id": 20266,
        "created_at": "2019-09-19T17:08:44Z",
        "updated_at": "2019-09-19T17:08:44Z"
    },
    "meta": {}
    }
}
```

## Creating a cart

To proceed to checkout, we'll need an active cart. To create one, send a request to the REST Management API's [Create a cart](/docs/rest-management/carts) endpoint.


```http filename="Example request: Create a cart" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/carts
X-Auth-Token: {{access_token}}
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "channel_id": 20266,
  "line_items": [
    {
      "quantity": 1,
      "product_id": 80,
      "variant_id": 64
    }
  ]
}
```

If you are creating a cart for a specific customer, pass in the `customer_id` in the request.

```json showLineNumbers copy
{
  "customer_id": 42,
  "line_items": [
    {
      "quantity": 5,
      "product_id": 191
    }
  ]
}
```

The response contains a cart ID you can use in subsequent requests:

```json filename="Example response: Create a cart" showLineNumbers copy
{
    "data": {
        "id": "33608b81-ba34-4ff2-8bab-2771aeab3f73",
    ...
    }
}
```

To generate a cart redirect URL, send a request to the [Create cart redirect URL](/docs/rest-management/carts/cart-redirect-urls#create-cart-redirect-url) endpoint. Use the cart ID returned with the [Create a cart](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/docs/rest-management/carts/carts-single#create-a-cart) response as the cartId path parameter value.

```http filename="Example response: Create cart redirect URLs" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/carts/{{cartId}}/redirect_urls
X-Auth-Token: {{access_token}}
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "cart_url": "https://store-id30h7ohwf.mybigcommerce.com/cart.php?action=load&id=bc218c65-7a32-4ab7-8082-68730c074d02&token=aa958e2b7922035bf3339215d95d145ebd9193deb36ae847caa780aa2e003e4b",
  "checkout_url": "https://store-id30h7ohwf.mybigcommerce.com/cart.php?action=loadInCheckout&id=bc218c65-7a32-4ab7-8082-68730c074d02&token=aa958e2b7922035bf3339215d95d145ebd9193deb36ae847caa780aa2e003e4b",
  "embedded_checkout_url": "https://store-id30h7ohwf.mybigcommerce.com/cart.php?embedded=1&action=loadInCheckout&id=bc218c65-7a32-4ab7-8082-68730c074d02&token=aa958e2b7922035bf3339215d95d145ebd9193deb36ae847caa780aa2e003e4b"
}
```

### Redirecting a signed-in customer to embedded checkout

For some use cases, you may want your customer to sign in before they can begin the checkout process.

Customers can sign in using the [Customer Login API](/api-docs/storefront/customer-login-api).

You will first need to use JSON Web Token Standard to create a new token. Use a [JWT library](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) to accomplish this. For more information, see [Create JWT Using the Debugger Tool](/api-docs/storefront/customer-login-api#create-jwt-using-the-debugger-tool).

Next, include the `embedded_checkout_url` as part of the request payload you send to BigCommerce.

```json filename="Example Customer Login JWT payload" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "iss": {{client_id}},
  "iat": 1535393113,
  "jti": {{uuid}},
  "operation": "customer_login",
  "store_hash": {{store_hash}},
  "customer_id": 2,
  "redirect_to": "https://store-id30h7ohwf.mybigcommerce.com/cart.php?action=loadInCheckout&id=bc218c65-7a32-4ab7-8082-68730c074d02&token=aa958e2b7922035bf3339215d95d145ebd9193deb36ae847caa780aa2e003e4b",
  "request_ip": "111.222.333.444"
}
```

<Callout type="info">
The `request_ip` field is optional.
</Callout>

## Embedding the checkout

Use the `embedded_checkout_url` that is returned from generating redirect URLs and assemble a JSON object. It will be used by the Checkout JS SDK to determine how to render the checkout.

<Callout type="info">
  When the shopper is signed in, use the `https://{{store-url}}/login/token/{{token}}` URL as the `url` option for `embedCheckout`. For unauthenticated shoppers, use the `embedded_checkout_url` as the `url` option instead.
</Callout>	

```json filename="JSON Object" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "containerId": "foo-bar-checkout",
  "url": "https://store-id30h7ohwf.mybigcommerce.com/cart.php?embedded=1&action=loadInCheckout&id=bc218c65-7a32-4ab7-8082-68730c074d02&token=aa958e2b7922035bf3339215d95d145ebd9193deb36ae847caa780aa2e003e4b"
}
```

Pass the object to the `embedCheckout` method of the Checkout SDK.

```js filename="embedCheckout method" showLineNumbers copy
embedCheckout({
  "containerId": "foo-bar-checkout",
  "url": "https://store-id30h7ohwf.mybigcommerce.com/cart.php?embedded=1&action=loadInCheckout&id=bc218c65-7a32-4ab7-8082-68730c074d02&token=aa958e2b7922035bf3339215d95d145ebd9193deb36ae847caa780aa2e003e4b"
});
```

This will render the checkout to an HTML element with the `id` you chose.

```html filename="HTML element" showLineNumbers copy
<div id="foo-bar-checkout"></div>
```

## FAQ

### How can I work with Embedded Checkout locally?

You can use ngrok to test Embedded Checkout locally. 
Steps:
1. Run your app on localhost.
2. Create a [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs#getting-started-expose) tunnel for the localhost port to your app.
3. Set your Channel Site URL to the HTTPS URL of the ngrok tunnel.
4. View your app from the ngrok URL.

NOTE: Use https://127.0.0.1 as the Channel site URL if you do not want to use ngrok.

### Are hosted payment gateways supported with Embedded Checkout?
At this time, you cannot embed a checkout using a hosted payment gateway. See [Available Payment Gateways](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Available-Payment-Gateways#all-available) to determine which type of gateway you're using.

### How do I resolve Embedded Checkout 403 "Cannot start checkout session with an empty cart" Errors?

For Embedded Checkout to work correctly for shoppers using a browser with restricted privacy settings (like Apple's Safari), your checkout page must be served from the same domain as your BigCommerce storefront. For example, if your headless storefront is `www.mystore.com`, then your BigCommerce store's domain should be `checkout.mystore.com`. For more information on making Embedded Checkout on a headless WordPress storefront compatible with Safari, see [BigCommerce for WordPress](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-for-WordPress-Checkout#safari).

### How do I make sure that authenticated shoppers who sign out from the checkout page are also signed out of the headless storefront?

To ensure you sign shoppers out of the checkout page and the headless storefront, pass the `onSignOut` option to `embedCheckout` to handle sign out events from the checkout page.
