# Tax Providers

The [Tax Provider API](/docs/rest-contracts/tax) allows you to provide business-to-consumer sales tax estimates to shoppers on the storefront and to merchants in the control panel; it can also be used to submit documents for tax reconciliation purposes.

The [Tax Provider API](/docs/rest-contracts/tax) works in conjunction with a BigCommerce app, so you will need to [build an app](/docs/integrations/apps) that integrates the [Tax Provider API](/docs/rest-contracts/tax).

Tax providers can publish their BigCommerce app so that it's discoverable by anyone or publish their app as unlisted so it can only be installed using a URL.

## Obtaining an app ID

To get your app ID, start by creating an app in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/), and fill out the information in the [Technical](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/publishing#add-technical-information) tab. In the URL, you will see your unique app ID.

[Learn more about finding your app's ID](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/id).

## Sharing provider details with BigCommerce

Once you've obtained your app ID, share your app ID and the information below with BigCommerce by emailing [taxproviderapi@bigcommerce.com](mailto:taxproviderapi@bigcommerce.com). This information allows us to create your tax provider configuration, which will take approximately five days.

Once your tax provider configuration is ready, we'll let you know through email. The email will also include your `provider_id`, which is required when [establishing a connection](#establishing-a-connection) with the [Tax Provider API](/docs/rest-contracts/tax).

| Tax Provider Details | Required / Optional | Value(s) | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| App ID | Required | Integer | Tells us which tax provider configuration to use after the app is installed. | `123456` |
| Tax provider name | Required | String | Displayed in the control panel (e.g. **Settings > Setup > Tax > Add tax service**). | `Sample Tax` |
| Transaction type | Required | Production, Test | Whether your tax provider will be handling production traffic or conducting test transactions. | `Production` |
| Partner support email | Required | Email | Used by BigCommerce to contact tax provider, in the case we need to forward a merchant support request or discuss integration improvements. | `support@sampletax.example.com` |
**Coverage** | | | | |
| Platform availability | Required | All stores, Limited availability | Whether your tax provider will be available to all stores or a limited number of stores. | `Limited availability` |
| Supported / unsupported countries | Required | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 | Comma separated ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes for supported countries. You may also select to support to all countries, or all countries except a list of unsupported countries. | `US,CA,GB,FR,AU,NZ` |
| **URLs** | | | | |
| <sup>+</sup>Estimate URL | Required | URL | URL BigCommerce should use for Tax Provider API estimate requests. | `https://sampletax.example.com/tax/estimate` |
| <sup>+</sup>Commit URL | Optional | URL | URL BigCommerce should use for Tax Provider API quote requests. | `https://sampletax.example.com/doc/commit` |
| <sup>+</sup>Adjust URL | Optional | URL | URL BigCommerce should use for Tax Provider API quote requests. | `https://sampletax.example.com/doc/adjust` |
| <sup>+</sup>Void URL | Optional | URL | URL BigCommerce should use for Tax Provider API quote requests. | `https://sampletax.example.com/doc/void` 
| **Testing** | | | | |
| Partner sandbox store domain | Required | Domain name | Share your partner sandbox store for testing purposes prior to launching your tax provider. Learn how to [create a partner sandbox store](/docs/start/about/sandboxes). | `https://sampletax-test-store.mybigcommerce.com/` |

<sup>+</sup> You have the option of supporting a URL that merchants can customize. See [Tax Profile](#tax-profile-optional).

### Tax profile (optional)

BigCommerce sets the tax provider registry with your URLs for [Tax Provider API](/docs/rest-contracts/tax) requests. BigCommerce sends requests to these URLs, for example, when a shopper requests tax estimates.
If you would like to support multiple connections for a merchant, BigCommerce can set the registry with flexible URLs that use our new profile option. 
These URLs would include a reserved string, for example, `https://{profile}/estimate`, allowing merchants to customize the base domain.   

When connecting or installing your app, you must allow merchants to enter the URL's base domain in the control panel. Merchants need to be able to self-serve updates to the URL through your app. 
When you [Establish a Tax Provider connection](#establishing-a-connection), include the `profile` base domain along with credentials associated with the merchant's account. 

<Callout type="info">
  You must liaise with the merchant to provide them with customized URLs. BigCommerce merely consumes the URL values the merchant enters and uses the provided string value for Tax Provider API requests.
</Callout>

### Sandbox tax provider configuration

Sandbox tax provider configurations are nested within your production tax provider configuration, as such tax providers requiring a sandbox tax provider configuration should also provide details for their production tax provider configuration.

Additionally, when providing the details for a sandbox tax provider configuration, it's unnecessary to specify the below properties because they are inherited from the primary production tax provider configuration (all other properties are still required):

* Merchant support email
* Merchant support URL
* Tax provider visibility
* Platform availability, i.e. all stores or only specified store hashes
* Supported / unsupported countries

<Callout type="info">
  We recommend tax providers request to create only one sandbox tax provider within their production tax provider configuration, any development procedures related to testing different estimate, commit, adjust and void Tax Provider API endpoints should be performed externally and decoupled from the BigCommerce platform to avoid unnecessary dependencies.
</Callout>


## Building the app

Tax providers must build a BigCommerce [single-click app](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/types#single-click) to utilize the Tax Provider API to provide tax estimates and submit tax documents. A BigCommerce single-click app provides many benefits. For example, it enables tax providers to promote their solution in the BigCommerce App Marketplace, ask for merchant authorization of API scopes during app install, and configure tax provider settings through an iFrame in the control panel.

Review our [introduction to building apps](/docs/integrations/apps) guide and use the sidebar to explore topics including: types of apps, managing apps in the dev portal, implementing OAuth, and designing the UI.

Make sure to also review our [app development best practices](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/best-practices) for some tips.

<Callout type="info">
  If you have registered your app in the Developer Portal but have not submitted it for approval because it's still in development, the app will be in a Draft state. This means your app can only be installed on stores owned by the same email address as the Developer Portal account email.
</Callout>


## Installing the app

When the merchant clicks **Install** on a tax provider's single-click app, it's essential that the app successfully handle the OAuth flow before moving on to the next step of establishing a connection with the [Tax Provider API](/docs/rest-contracts/tax). The [Apps Guide](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/auth) provides an overview of the OAuth flow.

When handling the OAuth flow, tax providers must ensure their app is requesting read and write permissions on the **Information and Settings** API scopes. Additionally, the tax provider should store the **client_id** and **access_token** that are received. Both are required later when [establishing a connection with the Tax Provider API](#establishing-a-connection).

## Establishing a connection

A tax provider is ready to establish a connection with the Tax Provider API when all of the following are true:

* Tax provider has shared their tax provider details with BigCommerce through email, and we've replied confirming the tax provider configuration is now ready on all supplied merchant and/or partner test stores (see [Sharing provider details with BigCommerce](#sharing-provider-details-with-bigcommerce)).
* BigCommerce has shared the `provider_id` of the tax provider configuration with the tax provider through email (see [Sharing provider details with BigCommerce](#sharing-provider-details-with-bigcommerce)).
* Tax provider has built a draft app that successfully handles the OAuth flow during app installation (see [Building the app](#building-the-app)).
* During the OAuth flow the app requested the merchant to authorize read and write permissions on the Information and Settings API scopes (see [Installing the app](#installing-the-app)).
* During the OAuth flow the `client_id` and `access_token` was received and stored by the tax provider (see [Installing the app](#installing-the-app)).

For context, the [Tax Provider API Connection endpoints](/docs/rest-contracts/tax-app-connection) provide an added layer of security for tax providers. They set basic authentication credentials for the tax provider and these basic credentials are used to authenticate each API request to the tax provider from the associated store.

In either case, the [Update Connection](/docs/apps-api/tax-app-connection#update-a-connection) endpoint should be called after the tax provider's app has been successfully installed. Tax providers will need to include `store_hash`, `provider_id`, and `X-Auth-Token`(`access_token`) values.

We recommend calling the [Update Connection](/docs/rest-contracts/tax-app-connection#update-a-connection) endpoint immediately after the app has been successfully installed, otherwise your tax provider will not be displayed when merchants navigate to the **Settings > Setup > Tax** page in the control panel.

The [Get a Connection](/docs/rest-contracts/tax-app-connection#get-connection-status) request may be used at any time to retrieve the connection status of the specified tax provider in the context of a store.

## Configure tax provider settings in the control panel

Once you have successfully installed the tax provider's app and provided basic authentication credentials through the Update a Connection request, supported merchants will be able to adjust the tax provider's settings to activate the tax provider's functions on their store.

To enable the tax provider to respond to tax estimate requests, the merchant must navigate to the provider's settings screen, found at **Settings > Setup > Tax > _TaxProviderName_** in the control panel, and select which supported countries or subdivisions the tax provider will fulfill tax quotes for.

Additionally, if document submission is supported by the tax provider, the merchant can choose to select the **Submit Order Data** checkbox in the provider's settings screen. This will enable document submission functions on their store, for supported transactions.

## Tax estimation

### When tax estimates are requested

Once the tax provider app has been enabled in the control panel, the tax provider is ready to respond to tax estimate requests sent by BigCommerce.

Tax estimates will be requested, depending on the BigCommerce store's settings, multiple times during a standard BigCommerce checkout flow.

* After selecting a shipping method when using the **Estimate Shipping & Tax functionality** on the cart page
* After specifying a shipping address during a checkout
* After specifying a billing address during a checkout

Estimate requests are not expected after the following events.

* While browsing a store's home page, product catalog or product pages.
* On the cart page prior to a shopper selecting a shipping method using the **Estimate Shipping & Tax** functionality.
* On the checkout page prior to specifying a shipping address.
* On the checkout page, when toggling any option related to using the shopper's shipping address as their billing address.

Estimate calls will also be made in the control panel when using flows like the following:

* Line-item refund flows
* Test connection functionality when merchants navigate to **Settings > Setup > Tax > _TaxProviderName_** in the control panel

<Callout type="info">
  Tax estimate requests sent by BigCommerce may not always contain complete data as these requests will be fired at different stages of the shopper checkout. For example, the **Estimate Shipping & Tax** functionality on the cart page does not provide any billing address data, but the tax provider will still be expected to return a valid tax estimate.
</Callout>


### Responding to tax estimate requests

When responding to tax estimate requests sent by BigCommerce, tax providers are required to include aggregates and breakdowns of sales tax amounts and rates for product item prices, shipping and handling prices. This is because when navigating to the **Settings > Setup > Tax > Tax Settings** page in the control panel, merchants have the ability to specify whether they would like to show taxes in cart, checkout, orders and invoice **As one summarized line item** or **Broken down by tax rate**.

[View the Estimate Taxes API reference](/docs/rest-contracts/tax#estimate-taxes).

## Document submission

Document submission enables tax providers to persist a tax quote request, replace it with another one, or invalidate it if necessary.

Supporting document submission is optional. However, tax providers wishing to support this functionality must share document submission URLs with BigCommerce when [sharing provider details with BigCommerce](#sharing-provider-details-with-bigcommerce).

If document submission is supported, navigate to **Settings > Setup > Tax > _TaxProviderName_** in the control panel and ensure the **Submit Order Data** checkbox is checked.

[View the Commit Tax Quote API reference](/docs/rest-contracts/tax#commit-tax-quote).

## Testing

Prior to testing a tax provider, the merchant or partner test store should have the following configured in the control panel:

* The store default country, found by navigating to **Settings > Store profile**, is set to a country that is supported by the tax provider
* The shipping origin address, found by navigating to **Settings > Shipping**, is configured. This value is included in tax estimate requests
* The tax provider, found by navigating to **Settings > Setup > Tax**, is enabled
* If document submission is supported, navigate to **Settings > Setup > Tax > _TaxProviderName_** and ensure the **Submit Order Data** checkbox is checked

To test the tax provider connection, navigate to **Settings > Setup > Tax > _TaxProviderName_** in the control panel and click **Test Connection**. This selection will trigger a sample tax estimate request to be sent to the estimate URL provided by the tax provider. If the connection is unsuccessful, merchants can navigate to **Settings > Advanced > Store logs** in the control panel to view the error and its description to assist with triaging the issue.
