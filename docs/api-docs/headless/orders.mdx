# Handling Orders

This section explains how to create and manage orders for headless storefronts.

## Creating an order from a cart

To successfully complete this section, you must first create a cart with a **redirect URL**. For instructions on how to create a cart, see the [Carts]() section of this tutorial.

### Adding a billing address

You can change a cart to a checkout by adding a billing address. To add a checkout billing address, send a `POST` request to the [Add Checkout Billing Address](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-billing-address#add-checkout-billing-address) endpoint. Your `checkoutId` will correspond with the cart `id` returned in response to [Create a Cart](/docs/rest-management/carts/carts-single#create-a-cart).

```http filename="Example request: Add checkout billing address" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/checkouts/{checkoutId}/billing-address
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "first_name": "Jane",
  "last_name": "Doe",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "address1": "123 Main Street",
  "address2": "",
  "city": "Austin",
  "state_or_province": "Texas",
  "state_or_province_code": "TX",
  "country_code": "US",
  "postal_code": "78751",
  "phone": "1234567890"
}
```

### Adding a consignment

Now that you have transformed your headless cart into a checkout, you need to add a consignment with a shipping address, line items, and a shipping option. You can do so following this two-step process:

**Step 1: Add a new consignment to the checkout**

Send a `POST` request to the [Add Consignment to Checkout](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-consignments#add-consignment-to-checkout) endpoint. Append the `include=consignments.available_shipping_options` query parameter to your `POST` request to return `available_shipping_options` (required for step two).

```http filename="Example request: Add Consignment to checkout" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/checkouts/{checkoutId}/consignments?include=consignments.available_shipping_options
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

[
  {
    "shipping_address": {
      "first_name": "Jane",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com",
      "address1": "123 Main Street",
      "address2": "",
      "city": "Austin",
      "state_or_province": "Texas",
      "state_or_province_code": "TX",
      "country_code": "US",
      "postal_code": "78751",
      "phone": "1234567890"
    },
    "line_items": [
      {
        "item_id": "7e2f9b22-a16e-4056-9e2d-8fc919bcf653",
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

The response will contain an array of `available_shipping_options`. You will use one of the available shipping options to update the consignment in the next step.

```json filename="Example response: Add Consignment to checkout" showLineNumbers copy
"available_shipping_options": [
  {
    "id": "80ad65f7946c23bd4ee9a531d85c5e21",
    "type": "shipping_pickupinstore",
    "description": "Pickup In Store",
    "image_url": "",
    "cost": 0,
    "transit_time": "",
    "additional_description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "4dcbf24f457dd67d5f89bcf374e0bc9b",
    "type": "freeshipping",
    "description": "Free Shipping",
    "image_url": "",
    "cost": 0,
    "transit_time": "",
    "additional_description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "85dfaf5f834d7e594f0bd7cf67d5b200",
    "type": "shipping_flatrate",
    "description": "Flat Rate",
    "image_url": "",
    "cost": 5,
    "transit_time": "",
    "additional_description": ""
  },
  {
    "id": "8809b0bbcc8bdc2d5cad2a4fcbd6cf09",
    "type": "shipping_byweight",
    "description": "Ship by Weight",
    "image_url": "",
    "cost": 10,
    "transit_time": "",
    "additional_description": ""
  }
]
```

**Step 2: Update the consignment**

Use one of the available shipping options to update the consignment you created in Step 1.
Send a `PUT` request to the [Update Checkout Consignment](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-consignments#update-checkout-consignment) endpoint.

```http filename="Example request: Update checkout consignment" showLineNumbers copy
PUT https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/checkouts/{checkoutId}/consignments/{consignmentId}
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "shipping_option_id": "4dcbf24f457dd67d5f89bcf374e0bc9b"
}
```


### Creating an order

Now that you have added a billing address and a consignment to your checkout, you can create an order by sending a `POST` request to the [Create an Order](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-orders#create-an-order) endpoint. The order status will be set to incomplete.

      "meta": {}
    }
    ```

## Processing payments

Depending on the shopper's card-on-file authorization, you can use one of the following methods to process the payment.

* **Stored Card** – A shopper has authorized a merchant to store their payment details.
* **Credit Card** – A shopper has not authorized a merchant to store their payment details.

### Using the Stored Card method

1. Start by retrieving the available payment methods. Send a `GET` request to the `Get Accepted Payment Methods` endpoint. 

```http filename="Example request: Get accepted payment methods" showLineNumbers copy
GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/payments/methods
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
```

1. To process a payment for an order, you will need to make a call to the Payments API which requires an access token. To generate an access token, send a `POST` request to the [Create Payment Access Token](/docs/rest-payments/tokens#create-payment-access-token) endpoint. 

```http filename="Example request: Create payment access token" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/payments/access_tokens
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "order": {
    "id": 125,
    "is_recurring": false
  }
}
```


Make a note of the access token `id`. This token is required in subsequent payment request to the [Process Payment](/docs/rest-payments/processing#process-payment) endpoint.

1. Send a `POST` request to the [Process Payment](/docs/rest-payments/processing#process-payment) endpoint. The headers to process a payment are different than the headers you normally send with a BigCommerce API. The authorization token is the ID returned in Create Payment Access Token (step two). To learn more, see [Stored cards](/api-docs/store-management/payments-api-overview#stored-cards).

        "status": "success",
        "transaction_type": "purchase"
      }
    }
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Using the Credit Card method

If a shopper does not have a payment method saved on file, you can process a payment using a credit card. There are two steps to this method:

1. Send a `POST` request to the [Create Payment Access Token](/docs/rest-payments/tokens#create-payment-access-token) endpoint to get the authorization token that needs to be passed in the header when processing the payment.

2. Send a `POST` request to the [Process Payment](/docs/rest-payments/processing#process-payment) endpoint. The headers to process a payment are different than the headers you normally send with a BigCommerce API. The Authorization token is the ID returned in Create Payment Access Token (step one). To learn more, see [Credit cards](/api-docs/store-management/payments-api-overview#credit-cards).

```json filename="Example response: Process payment" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "data": {
    "id": "693bb4cd-3f20-444a-8315-6369f582c68a",
    "status": "success",
    "transaction_type": "purchase"
  }
}
```

A successful transaction will return a status of success. The order is then automatically moved to an Awaiting Fulfillment status. If you get a different response, see [Error Codes](/api-docs/store-management/payments-api-overview#error-codes) for troubleshooting.
