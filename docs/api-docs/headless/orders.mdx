# Handling Orders

This section explains how to create and manage orders for headless storefronts.

## Creating an order from a cart

To successfully complete this section, you must first create a cart with a **redirect URL**. For instructions on how to create a cart, see the [Carts article in this guide](/docs/storefront/headless/cart-checkout/carts).

### Adding a billing address

You can change a cart to a checkout by adding a billing address. To add a checkout billing address, send a request to the [Add Checkout Billing Address](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-billing-address#add-checkout-billing-address) endpoint. Your `checkoutId` will correspond with the cart ID returned by the [Create a Cart](/docs/rest-management/carts/carts-single#create-a-cart) endpoint. For an example request, see the [End-to-End Guide: Headless Checkout Flow with REST Management APIs](/docs/storefront/headless/end-to-end-guide/rest).

### Adding a consignment

Now that you have transformed your headless cart into a checkout, you need to add a consignment with a shipping address, line items, and a shipping option. You can do so by adding and then updating a consignment. For an example request, see the [End-to-End Guide: Headless Checkout Flow with REST Management APIs](/docs/storefront/headless/end-to-end-guide/rest).

### Creating an order

Now that you have added a billing address and a consignment to your checkout, you can create an order by sending a request to the [Create an Order](/docs/rest-management/checkouts/checkout-orders#create-an-order) endpoint. When a new order is created by API, the order status is set to incomplete.

## Processing payments

Depending on the shopper's card-on-file authorization, you can use one of the following methods to process the payment.

* **Stored Card** – A shopper has authorized a merchant to store their payment details.
* **Credit Card** – A shopper has not authorized a merchant to store their payment details.

### Using the Stored Card method

1. Start by retrieving the available payment methods. Send a `GET` request to the `Get Accepted Payment Methods` endpoint. 

```http filename="Example request: Get accepted payment methods" showLineNumbers copy
GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/payments/methods
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
```

2. To process a payment for an order, you must make a call to the Payments API, which requires an payment access token. To generate a payment access token, or _PAT_, send a request to the [Create Payment Access Token](/docs/rest-payments/tokens#create-payment-access-token) endpoint. 

```http filename="Example request: Create payment access token" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/payments/access_tokens
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}

{
  "order": {
    "id": 125,
    "is_recurring": false
  }
}
```

Make a note of the access token `id`. This token is required in the subsequent order payment call to the [Process Payment](/docs/rest-payments/processing#process-payment) endpoint.

3. Send a request to the [Process Payment](/docs/rest-payments/processing#process-payment) endpoint. The headers to process a payment are different than the headers you normally send with a BigCommerce API. The `Authorization` bearer token is the PAT ID returned by the Create Payment Access Token endpoint (step two). To learn more, see [Payments API: Stored Cards](/docs/store-operations/payments#stored-cards).

        },
        "payment_method_id": "adyenv2.scheme",
        "save_instrument": true
      }
    }
  ```

      "data": {
        "id": "693bb4cd-3f20-444a-8315-6369f582c68a",
        "status": "success",
        "transaction_type": "purchase"
      }
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

### Using the Credit Card method

If a shopper does not have a payment method saved on file, you can process a payment using a credit card. There are two steps to this method:

1. Send a request to the [Create Payment Access Token](/docs/rest-payments/tokens#create-payment-access-token) endpoint to get the payment access token that must be passed using the `Authorization` header to process the payment.

2. Send a request to the [Process Payment](/docs/rest-payments/processing#process-payment) endpoint. The headers to process a payment are different than the headers you normally send with a BigCommerce API. The `Authorization` bearer token is the PAT ID returned by the Create Payment Access Token endpoint (step one). To learn more, see [Payments API: Credit Cards](/docs/store-operations/payments#credit-cards).

```json filename="Example response: Process payment" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "data": {
    "id": "693bb4cd-3f20-444a-8315-6369f582c68a",
    "status": "success",
    "transaction_type": "purchase"
  }
}
```

A successful transaction will return a `success` status. The order status is then automatically changed to `Awaiting Fulfillment`. If you get a different response, see [Error Codes](/docs/store-operations/payments#error-codes) for troubleshooting.
