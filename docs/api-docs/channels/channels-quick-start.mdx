# Building Channels Quick Start

This advanced, quick-start tutorial is for [BigCommerce partners](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/) wishing to market their solution within [Channel Manager's](/docs/integrations/channels#resources) **Create Channel** flow. For an introduction to channels on BigCommerce, see [Channels Overview](/docs/integrations/channels).


### Prerequisites


- Experience [building apps](/docs/integrations/apps)
- Familiarity with [Channels Toolkit](/docs/integrations/channels)

## Create a channel

Apps curated as solutions within the **Create Channel** flow must create a basic channel with a reference to their BigCommerce [App ID](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/id). This enables them to be shown in the [Channel Manager](/docs/integrations/channels) as managing a specific channel; it also improves the native look and feel for the merchant using the app.

To [create a channel](/docs/rest-management/channels#create-a-channel), send a `POST` request to `/v3/channels`.

```http filename="Example request: Create a channel" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/channels
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
  "name": "Solution Name",
  "type": "storefront",
  "platform": "drupal",
  "external_id": "",
  "is_enabled": true,
  "status": "connected",
  "is_listable_from_ui": true,
  "is_visible": true,
  "config_meta": {
    "app": {
      "id": 24483
    }
  }
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  - For a list of accepted `type` and `platform` values, see [Channels API Reference](/docs/rest-management/channels#platform).
  - For instructions on finding your app's ID, see [Find and App's ID](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/id).
</Callout>

## Create a channel with navigation

We recommend that apps also create navigation sections to better integrate the app's interface within the BigCommerce control panel.

To create a channel with navigation, use the [Channel Menus API](/docs/rest-management/channels/channel-menus#create-channel-menus) after creating a channel record.

```http filename="Example request: Create channel menus" showLineNumbers copy
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/channels/{{CHANNEL_ID}}/channel-menus
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

{
    "bigcommerce_protected_app_sections": [
      "domains",
      "currencies",
      "storefront_settings"
    ],
    "custom_app_sections": [
      {
        "title": "Overview",
        "query_path": "overview"
      }
    ]  
}
```
