When you enable ShipperHQ on a store, additional fields become available on the product level:
* [Shipping Groups](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/ShipperHQ#ship-groups)
* [Origin Locations](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/ShipperHQ#origin-loc)
* [Dimensional Rules](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/ShipperHQ#dim-rules) 

These field values can be set in the Control Panel by the merchant as well as using one of the following:
* [Product Metafields Endpoint](/api-reference/catalog/catalog-api/product-metafields/createproductmetafield)
* [Variant Metafields Endpoint](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/catalog/catalog-api/product-variants-metafields/createvariantmetafield)

<!-- theme: warning -->
### Entering metafield data
> You must enter the metafields exactly, otherwise, they will not work. Since metafields can store information against a product, if the `namespace` for example is set to shipping and not `shipping.shipperhq`, it will not update the shipping information.

## Control panel behavior

When you set Shipping Origins using the API, you cannot delete the fields using the control panel. You must send a `DELETE` request to the metafields resource.
