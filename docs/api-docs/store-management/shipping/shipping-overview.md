Shipments are created from orders. A [shipment](/api-reference/orders/orders-api/order-shipments/createordershipments) represents a grouping of order line items that are shipped to a customer, and multiple shipments can be created from a single order.

The V2 Shipping API allows you to manage Shipping Zones, Shipping Methods, and Shipping Carrier Connections.

The Order Shipments resource creates a shipment for an order. You can specify the shipping provider, tracking number and shipping address id when creating a shipment.

## Storefront Checkout and Server-to-Server Checkout API

The [Storefront Checkout](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/storefront-checkout-api) and [Server-to-Server Checkout APIs](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-checkout-api) provide methods for managing a checkout up until the point when it is finalized into an order. Because shipments can only be created from finalized orders, a shipment cannot be created from Checkout API endpoints.

However, both the Storefront and Server-to-Server Checkout APIs provide methods for creating a Consignment, which specifies the line items that should ship to a particular address. Creating a Consignment corresponds with the actions that a shopper might take when filling out the storefront checkout page, assigning the items in their basket to their respective shipping destinations.

A Checkout will always have one Consignment assigned to it, which is the first shipping address. A Consignment supports multiple shipping addresses, with each address having its own line items.

## Order Shipping Addresses

The [Order Shipping Addresses](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/order-shipping-addresses) endpoint allows you to view the shipping addresses on an order. This will be the address(es) the items are shipped to.  An order can have more than one shipping address.

## Shipping Zone and Shipping Methods

[Shipping zones ](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-zones)can be configured in the control panel or using the API to designate where a merchant ships their products and which [shipping methods](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-method) should be available in each geographic region.

An example of a shipping zone might be North America, and within that shipping zone, the shipping methods might be Free Shipping, Ship-by-Weight, and USPS.

## Real-Time Carriers

BigCommerce offers native integrations with many real-time shipping carriers such as UPS, Fedex, and USPS. The [Real-Time Carriers](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/shipping-api/shipping-carrier) resource allows you to connect an account for one of our natively supported shipping carrier integrations.

For a list of all supported carriers, see [Real-Time Quote Providers](https://support.bigcommerce.com/articles/Public/Setting-Up-a-Real-Time-Shipping-Quote-Shipping-Method/#providers).
