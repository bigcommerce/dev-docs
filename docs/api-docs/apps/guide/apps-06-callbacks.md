# Single-Click App Callback Handlers

After a store owner installs your single-click app, they and their authorized users will need to use it and configure any settings. In turn, your app will likely need to store and manage information about the stores and users you're supporting.

Your app's front-end views render inside an iFrame in the store control panel, so your app has no native ability to listen for a few high-level events. To support your work, BigCommerce sends `GET` requests to callback routes in your app that correspond to three events: opening the app, uninstalling the app, and revoking a user's access to the app. Each request includes a signed JSON web token (_JWT_), which contains identifying information about the store and the user. This article is a reference for endpoints to which we send event-driven callbacks, and a guide to writing handlers that verify and use our JWT payloads.

<!-- theme: info -->
> #### Note
> In production, all app callback URLs must be publicly available, fully qualified, and served over TLS/SSL.


## Overview

The following table lists the app management events and corresponding endpoints to which our servers dispatch callbacks. Your app is only required to handle the `GET /load` endpoint, but we recommend writing handlers for all of them. Please see the corresponding detail sections that follow for more about the consequences of not handling optional callback endpoints.

| Endpoint           | Required? | Event Description                                         |
|:-------------------|:---------:|:----------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET /load`        | yes       | The store owner or authorized user clicks to load the app |
| `GET /uninstall`   | no        | The store owner clicks to uninstall the app               |
| `GET /remove_user` | no        | The store owner revokes a user's access to the app        |

Decoding the supplied JWT lets your app do the following:
- Identify the store.
- Identify the requesting user.
- Verify that the request came from BigCommerce.

<!-- theme: info -->
> #### Note
> We strongly recommend that each callback handler decode `signed_payload_jwt` to [verify the payload](#decode-and-verify-the-jwt) before taking any action.


## Open the app with /load

Once the store owner installs your app, it appears on the **Apps** sub-menu list in their store's control panel, as well as their authorized users' control panels. When a user clicks your app's listing, BigCommerce dispatches a `GET` request to the `/load` route you've written. The following is an example request:

```http title="Load GET request from BigCommerce to your app"
GET /load?signed_payload_jwt=hw9fhkx2ureq.t73sk8y80jx9 HTTP/1.1
Host: your_app.example.com
```

After you [verify the payload](#decode-and-verify-the-jwt), [identify the requesting user](#work-with-payload-claims), and handle any internal business, your app should respond with the markup and assets for the view that you want BigCommerce to render in the control panel.

## Remove the app with /uninstall

When the store owner clicks the **Uninstall** button on your app's card in their store's control panel, BigCommerce dispatches a `GET` request to the `/uninstall` route you've written. The following is an example request:

```http title="Uninstall GET request from BigCommerce to your app"
GET /uninstall?signed_payload_jwt=hw9fhkx2ureq.t73sk8y80jx9 HTTP/1.1
Host: your_app.example.com
```

After you [verify the payload](#decode-and-verify-the-jwt) and [identify the requesting user](#work-with-payload-claims), handle any business internal to your app, such as marking the user inactive in your app's database or decrementing the number of active installations. You do not need to send a response. If you do not write a handler for the `GET /uninstall` endpoint, BigCommerce will still uninstall your app from the owner's store, but your app will not know that.
## Revoke user access with /remove_user

When the store owner revokes a user's authorization to access your app at **Account Settings** **>** **Users** in the store control panel, BigCommerce dispatches a `GET` request to the `/remove_user` route you've written.

```http title="Remove user GET request from BigCommerce to your app"
GET /remove_user?signed_payload_jwt=hw9fhkx2ureq.t73sk8y80jx9 HTTP/1.1
Host: your_app.example.com
```

After you [verify the payload](#decode-and-verify-the-jwt) and [identify the requesting user](#work-with-payload-claims), handle any business internal to your app, such as removing the user's data from your app's database. You do not need to send a response. If you do not write a handler for the `GET /remove_user` endpoint, BigCommerce will still revoke the user's access to your app in the store control panel, but your app will not know that.

## Decode and verify the JWT

BigCommerce's payload JWTs implement the JWT-JWS specification that the [IETF's](https://www.ietf.org/) open standard [RFC 7515](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7515) defines. The `signed_payload_jwt` is composed of three distinct **base64URL**-encoded strings concatenated with the `.` character.

```js title="Form of payload JWT"
header_b64.payload_claims_b64.signature_b64
```

Use the following steps to decode, verify, and parse the JWTs that BigCommerce sends to your app's callback endpoints:

**Decompose the JWT**
1. Split the `signed_payload_jwt` by the `.` delimiter.

**Identify the signing algorithm**
2. Decode the **base64url** `header_b64`. `header_str` is a JSON string.
3. Parse `header_str` into a JSON object. Locate the signing algorithm's name at `header_obj.alg`.

**Decode the signature** 
4. Decode the **base64url** `signature_b64`. `signature_crypt` is a cryptographic hash.

**Concatenate and sign the header and payload claims**
5. Concatenate `header_b64` and `payload_claims_b64` with a `.` delimiter to create `header_payload_b64`.
6. Use the algorithm specified at `header_obj.alg` to sign `header_payload_b64` with your app's `CLIENT_SECRET`. `header_payload_crypt` is a cryptographic hash.

**Verify the payload claims**
7. Compare `header_payload_crypt` with `signature_crypt`. If BigCommerce sent your app this JWT, the two hashes will match. _We strongly recommend using a constant time string comparison function. See the following warning about security precautions for further information._

**Parse and use the payload**
8. Decode the **base64url** `payload_claims_b64`. `payload_claims_str` is a JSON string.
9. Parse `payload_claims_str` into your language's version of a JSON object. The following section is a reference for working with the values in `payload_claims_obj`.

<!-- theme: warning -->
> #### Security precautions
> Your production code should never work with claims from a payload you can't verify.
> To limit the vulnerability of an app to timing attacks, we recommend using a constant time string comparison function. Comparison techniques vary by programming language and signing algorithm. Ruby and PHP [code samples](#code-samples) for HS256 hashes follow. 
> We recommend writing middleware or using an existing [library in your language of choice](https://jwt.io/libraries) to help you decode, verify, and parse JWTs.

## Work with payload claims

The following is an example of the payload claims in a BigCommerce app callback JWT:

```json title="Example: app callback payload" lineNumbers
{
  "aud": "U8RphZeDjQc4kLVSzNjePo0CMjq7yOg", // your app's CLIENT_ID
  "iss": "bc",
  "iat": 1640037763,
  "nbf": 1640037758,
  "exp": 1640124163,
  "jti": "c5f0bcf5-a504-4ae6-8dcc-0e40eaa5a070", // JWT unique identifier
  "sub": "stores/z4zn3wo", // STORE_HASH
  "user": {
    "id": 9128,
    "email": "user@mybigcommerce.com"
  },
  "owner": {
    "id": 9128,
    "email": "user@mybigcommerce.com"
  },
  "url": "/" // deep link, if any
}
```

| Name          | Data Type | Value Description                                 |
|:--------------|:----------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| `user.id`     | integer   | ID of user initiating callback                    |
| `user.email`  | string    | email of the user initiating callback             |
| `owner.id`    | integer   | ID of store owner                                 |
| `owner.email` | string    | email address of store owner                      |
| `context`     | string    | `stores/` + `store_hash`; ex: `stores/store_hash` |
| `store_hash`  | string    | unique identified for store used in API requests  |
| `timestamp`   | float     | Unix time when callback generated                 |

Use the payload claims' data to identify the store and user. What your app should do with this information typically depends on whether it supports [multiple users](/api-docs/apps/guide/users). Refer to the following table for instructions:

| Endpoint | Multiple Users Enabled | Multiple Users Not Enabled |
|:---------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------|
| `GET /load` | Compare user to store owner or existing user; if no match, it's a new user; add them to the app's database. | Matches store owner |
| `GET /uninstall` | Compare user to store owner or existing user; only store owner can uninstall an app. | Matches store owner |
| `GET /remove_user` | Compare user to users stored in app database; remove matching user from database. | N/A |
