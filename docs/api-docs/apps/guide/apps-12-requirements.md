The Apps Marketplace team reviews all app submissions and tests apps to verify they meet [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) listing standards. Verify your app meets the requirements below before submitting it for approval.

## General requirements
- Make support resources available throughout the app, during onboarding, and on the app's dashboard.
- Follow branding guidelines when referencing BigCommerce (see our [Media Kit](https://www.bigcommerce.com/press/media-kit/) for more information).
- Don't reference competitor platforms in the app's listing information or dashboard.
- Use the same app name in app submission and in app content, such as logos and descriptions.
- Keep app titles concise. Avoid using extra taglines or descriptors; include those in the app summary, if necessary.
- Include the name of both your brand and any connected third-party platforms in the title; for example, "Marketplace by BigCommerce" or "Search by BigCommerce".
- Develop app client-side code to be compatible with all BigCommerce [supported browsers](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Themes-Supported-Browsers).

## Listing

* Approval for the [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) requires all fields listed in the **Publishing App** section (**Case Studies** and **Videos** are optional).
* Listings should be well worded, cleanly formatted, and follow wording and image specifications.
* App listing name should be restricted to only branding and not include taglines.

## Functionality

* Apps must work as intended and cannot conflict with BigCommerce functionality.
* Apps must use V3 endpoints in favor of V2 endpoints when feature parity exists.
* Apps must serve all callback URLs over HTTPS.
* Apps in the Marketplace must be multi-user enabled.
* Apps that process transactions or handle credit card data must pass a PCI Compliance review by BigCommerceâ€™s security team.
* Apps that add another marketplace or sales channel to a store must make use of the Channels API and follow Channel App Requirements.

## Installation

- Apps should be [single-click](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/guide/types-of-apps#single-click-apps) and use OAuth flow to authenticate<sup>1</sup>.
- Apps must respond to `install` callback with styled HTML for the control panel iFrame. This content cannot be blank and must follow our [user-interface constraints](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/building-apps-bigcommerce/building-apps#building-apps_user-interface-constraints).
- Apps must store user tokens against the store hash, not the user's email address, to avoid problems with ownership changes and multiple user support.
- Apps need to include options for new user registration as well as existing users.
