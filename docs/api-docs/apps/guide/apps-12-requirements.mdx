# App Store Approval Requirements



The Marketplace team reviews all app submissions and tests apps to verify they meet [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) listing standards. Verify your app meets the requirements below before submitting it for approval.

## General requirements

- Make support resources available throughout the app, like during onboarding and on the app's dashboard within the BigCommerce iframe.
- Follow branding guidelines when referencing BigCommerce (see our [Media Kit](https://www.bigcommerce.com/press/media-kit/) for more information).
Don't reference competitor platforms in the app's listing information or dashboard.
* Use the same app name in app submission and in app content such as logos and descriptions.
* Keep app titles concise. Avoid using extra taglines or descriptors; include those in the app summary, if necessary.
* Include the name of both your brand and any connected third-party platforms in the title (ex:
"Marketplace by BigCommerce" or "Search by BigCommerce").
- Develop app client-side code to be compatible with all BigCommerce [supported browsers](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Themes-Supported-Browsers) and default features.
- Include applicable test account details in your test instructions with the submission for any third-party services required in the app.
- Use BigCommerce APIs for app functionality wherever possible. For example, don't require a merchant to manually import a product CSV if those products can be retrieved using the BigCommerce API.


## Listing

* Approval for the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) requires all fields listed in the Publishing Apps section (**Case Studies** and **Videos** are optional).
* Listings should be well worded, cleanly formatted, and follow wording and image specifications.
* App listing name should be restricted to only branding and not include taglines.

## Functionality

* Apps must work as intended and cannot conflict with BigCommerce functionality.
* Apps must use V3 endpoints in favor of V2 endpoints when feature parity exists.
* Apps must serve all callback URLs over HTTPS.
* Apps in the App Marketplace must be [multi-user enabled](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/users).
* Apps that process transactions or handle credit card data must pass a PCI Compliance review by BigCommerce's security team. New payment gateway app submissions may not be accepted for App Marketplace review.
* Apps that access the Checkout Content scope will also be subject to a security assessment by BigCommerce's security team.
* Apps that modify the checkout experience must use the BigCommerce [Checkout SDK](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/checkout-sdk).
* Apps that add another marketplace or sales channel to a store should make use of the [Channels Toolkit](/docs/integrations/channels/guide) and follow [Channel App Requirements](/docs/integrations/channels/guide/requirements).
* Apps that create orders in the BigCommerce store need to properly mark accurate order source, payment method, and other order details.

## Installation

* Apps should be [single-click](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/types#single-click) and use [OAuth flow](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/auth) to authenticate.
* Apps must respond to install [callback](/docs/integrations/apps/guide/callbacks) with styled and branded HTML for the control panel iframe; this content cannot be blank and must follow our user-interface constraints. Apps using [BigDesign](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/big-design/) are preferred.
* Apps must store user tokens against the store hash, not the user's email address, to avoid problems with ownership changes and multiple user support.
* Apps need to include options for new user registration as well as existing users.
* Apps should autofill registration fields such as email address and store URL based on the store's information.
* Apps should include onboarding instructions and any setup requirements after installing.
* Apps that install scripts must use the [Scripts API](/docs/rest-management/scripts) to insert into Script Manager using proper `consent_category`.
