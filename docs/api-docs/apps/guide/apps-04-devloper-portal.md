# Managing Apps in the Developer Portal



App developers create, edit, and submit apps for approval using the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/). In [Beginning App Development](/api-docs/apps/guide/development) we briefly touched on how to create a draft app. In this article, we'll go over how to perform other common app management tasks in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/). For detailed instructions on submitting apps for approval, see [Publishing Apps](/api-docs/apps/guide/publishing).
