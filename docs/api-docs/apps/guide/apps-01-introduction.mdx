# Introduction to Building Apps

Using BigCommerce's powerful APIs, SDKs, and toolkits, developers can build apps that are installable on BigCommerce stores. Once approved, apps can be sold (or made available free of charge) to all BigCommerce merchants on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps). This is the first article in a comprehensive developer's guide to building BigCommerce apps. It provides a brief, high-level introduction for developers new to the platform. If you already have experience developing for BigCommerce, feel free to [skip ahead](#next-steps) or check out the [quick start tutorial](/docs/integrations/apps/quick-start).


## About BigCommerce apps

Let's first take a look how apps are discovered, displayed, and managed on BigCommerce stores.

### Discovery
Approved apps are listed on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) for merchants to browse, search, and install.

### Management
Apps installed on a store are managed in the store's control panel under **Apps** > [**My Apps**](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/marketplace/apps/my-apps/drafts). Here, store users can launch or uninstall the app.

### Display
When a merchant launches an app, BigCommerce makes a request to the app's `/load` callback and displays the app's UI in an iFrame.

## Use cases
What can developers do with BigCommerce apps?

### Integrate with business systems
Use [BigCommerce APIs](/docs/api) to integrate stores with business systems such as the following:
* [ERP systems](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/categories/erp/)
* [Order management platforms](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/categories/catalog-order-management/)
* [Accounting software](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/categories/accounting-tax/)
* [Shipping and Fulfillment services](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/categories/shipping-fulfillment/)

[Learn more about BigCommerce's APIs](/docs/api).


### Connect to sales channels
List products on external [sales channels](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/categories/sales-channels/) with [Channels Toolkit](/docs/integrations/channels/toolkit-reference).

[Learn more about connecting apps to sales channels.](/docs/integrations/channels).

### Add and manage scripts
Create and manage scripts with [Scripts API](/docs/rest-management/scripts) and [Script Manager](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Using-Script-Manager).

[Learn more about creating scripts](/docs/integrations/scripts).

### Create custom widgets
Create [widgets](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Page-Builder#builder) for merchants to install and configure.

[Learn more about creating widgets](/docs/storefront/widgets).
