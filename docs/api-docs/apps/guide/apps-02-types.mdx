# Types of Apps

The first step when developing an app is deciding which type of app to develop. The two types of apps, single-click and connector, are defined by the method of authentication. [Single-click](#single-click) apps use an OAuth Authorization Code Grant flow. [Connector apps](#connector) require store owners to manually generate and configure store API credentials. In addition to the authentication method, apps can differ by [visibility](#visibility).

## Single-Click

Single-click apps are the recommended app type. They use [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant](https://oauth.net/2/grant-types/authorization-code/) (oauth2.net) flow. Users initiate installation by clicking **Install**.

The app requests the user to grant permissions associated to scopes configured for the app in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps):

![App Permissions](https://storage.googleapis.com/bigcommerce-production-dev-center/images/apps/apps-02-types-02.png "App Permissions")

Once granted, the app can request a permanent `access_token` for making REST API requests on the user's behalf.

Single-click apps can use [App Extensions](/docs/integrations/apps/app-extensions).

## Connector
Connector apps use manual OAuth token creation instead of the single-click app flow. Store owners manually generate [store-level API credentials](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#revoking-store-level-api-credentials) and enter them into the app's configuration. While single-click apps are recommended, the following use cases might not be compatible:

- Customized integrations that vary per store.
- Integrations that do not provide any content for an iFrame.
- Apps that do not provide web services for OAuth exchange (ex: native order sync app).

## Visibility
There are three visibility options for apps: **Draft**, **Unlisted**, and **Public**.

| Visibility | Description | Use Cases |
|:-----------|:------------|:----------|
| Draft | Apps registered in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) but never submitted for approval | <li>Installing on stores owned by the same email address as the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/auth/bigcommerce) account email</li><li>Beta testing before publishing to the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/)</li> |
| Unlisted | Apps submitted and approved but not listed on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) | <li>Installing on stores not owned by same email address as the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/auth/bigcommerce) account email</li><li>Beta testing before publishing to the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/)</li> |
| Public | Apps submitted, approved, and listed on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) | <li>Making apps visible and installable on all stores</li><li>Making apps sellable on the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/)</li> |

<Callout type="info">
  * Only approved [partners](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/) can create unlisted apps.
  * To have an app unlisted, contact <a href="mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com">appstore@bigcommerce.com</a>.
