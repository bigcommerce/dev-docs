Using BigCommerce's powerful APIs, SDKs, and toolkits, developers can build apps that are installable on BigCommerce stores. Once approved, apps can be sold (or made available free of charge) to all BigCommerce merchants on the [Apps Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps). This is the first article in a comprehensive developer's guide to building BigCommerce apps. It provides a brief, high-level introduction for developers new to the platform. If you already have experience developing for BigCommerce, feel free to [skip ahead](#next-steps) or check out the [quick start tutorial](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/apps/quick-start).


## About BigCommerce apps

Let's first take a look how apps are discovered, displayed, and managed on BigCommerce stores.

### Discovery
Approved apps are listed on the app [Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) for merchants to browse, search, and install.

### Management
Apps installed on a store are managed in the store's control panel under **Apps** > [**My Apps**](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/marketplace/apps/my-apps/drafts). Here, store users can launch or uninstall the app.

### Display
When a merchant launches an app, BigCommerce makes a request to the app's `/load` callback and displays the app's UI in an iFrame.
