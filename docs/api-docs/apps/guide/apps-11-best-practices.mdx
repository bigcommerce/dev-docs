# App Development Best Practices



Review the following best practices before submitting your app to the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/).

## OAuth flow

### Follow security best practices and requirements

[RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10) discusses OAuth security considerations, recommendations, and requirements. Here's a summary of important items applicable to apps:
* Request access tokens with minimal scopes necessary.
* Serve all redirect URIs over TLS.
* Keep access tokens confidential in transit and storage.
* Do not transmit access tokens, refresh tokens, or client credentials in the clear.
* Do not transmit authorization codes in the clear.
* Educate end-users about the risks phishing attacks pose.
* Provide mechanisms that make it easy for end-users to confirm the authenticity of your app.
* Implement CSRF protection on redirect URI.

For details, see [Security Considerations in RC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-10). For a list of the top web application security risks and best practices to avoid them, see [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/).

## API requests

For recommendations on API request-related best practices, including rate limits, threading, parallel requests, and the finer points of request headers, see our article on [Best Practices](/api-docs/getting-started/best-practices).

## Webhook events

### Use webhooks to keep app data up-to-date

Rather than polling endpoints, get notified when updates occur by subscribing to [webhooks](/api-docs/getting-started/webhooks/about-webhooks).

## User interface

### Manage user session timeouts

Add BigCommerce's JavaScript SDK to your single-click app's front-end to prevent users from getting logged out of the control panel while using your app. To do so, reference the following script in your app's client-side code:

```js copy
      https://cdn.bigcommerce.com/jssdk/bc-sdk.js
```

To perform some action when a logout occurs, specify an `onLogout` callback:


```js copy
Bigcommerce.init({
      onLogout: callback
});
```

### Streamline new user onboarding

- If your app has a new user form, we recommend auto-filling input fields with data from the [Store Information API](/docs/rest-management/store-information), which manages much of the info you need.
- If your app doesn't have an approval process for new users, consider automatically generating accounts for new stores that install your app.
- If your app requires the user to sign in at launch, use the information BigCommerce sends to your callback URL to authenticate the user without asking for a username and password each time.
- If you plan to share user testimonials, add a link to your full case study in the case studies field.

## Deployment

### Consider hosting on Google Cloud Platform's us-central1 region

BigCommerce hosts [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) in the [us-central1](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/regions-zones/) region; maximize performance by hosting in the same region.
