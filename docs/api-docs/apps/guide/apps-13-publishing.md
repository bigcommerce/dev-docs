After completing development, verifying best practices, and checking approval requirements, you may submit your app for Marketplace approval in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/). This article takes you step-by-step through the submission form and provides descriptions for each field.

## Before you begin

Your listing on the [Apps Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) plays a major role in your app's success. A good listing accomplishes three goals:
*  Shows users how your platform or solution differs from competitive offerings
* Includes keywords so prospective users can find your listing in searches
* Sets up clear and accurate user expectations as to your solution's features and functionality

Before you begin completing the app registration, we recommend prepping the following assets:
* Company logos
* Screenshots and video content
* Case studies

We also recommend giving special attention to the following search indexed fields:
* App name
* App summary
* App category

## Provide a summary

To begin the app certification process, we'll need some basic information about you.

## FAQ

**Are all fields required?**

While not all fields are required to publish edits for your listing, they are all highly recommended. Without filling in all fields, your listing will be missing information that merchants have seen on other listings and expect to see throughout the Marketplace.

**Am I able to preview the changes to my listing before publishing them?**

Yes! With the updated fields in the Developer Portal, we're also adding the ability to
preview how these changes will appear on the BigCommerce Marketplace. You will see the option to preview on a new step after Review when editing your listing.

**Is there a draft status for these changes, or will saving make them live?**

Any changes you save will take effect immediately, so make sure you're ready to push them out to the Marketplace before saving.

**I've logged in to the Developer Portal, but I don't see my published listing. Where is it?**

You may have logged in with the wrong account. Each listing can only be owned by one user, so it is likely assigned to another email address. If you're unable to track down the correct owner account for your solution, please reach out to [appstore@bigcommerce.com](mailto:appstore@bigcommerce.com).

**I saved my changes, but my listing has not updated yet. What's the problem?**

The changes will be effective immediately in your control panel app card, but the updates
can take up to 24 hours to appear on the Apps Marketplace. Feel free to use this as a grace period to make edits as needed.
