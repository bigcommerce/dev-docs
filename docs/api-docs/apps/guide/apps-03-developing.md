# Beginning App Development



The BigCommerce team has developed an array of sample apps and tools to assist developers in the initial phase of app development. In this article, we'll introduce those tools and go over how to begin app development by installing and registering a draft app.

## Getting started
Here's a few things you'll need before beginning app development:
1. [BigCommerce sandbox store](/api-docs/partner/getting-started/create-a-sandbox-store) (required to test app installation)
2. [Developer Portal Account](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) (required to register apps)
3. [BigCommerce partnership](https://www.bigcommerce.com/partners/) (required to publish apps to marketplace)

## Beginning quickly
The fastest way to begin app development is by starting with one of our sample apps. You can follow our [Building Apps Quick Start Tutorial](/api-docs/apps/quick-start), either alone or in conjunction with [spinning up a Heroku instance](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs) that runs our [Node / React / Next.js sample app](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs/).  

Alternatively, you can clone the GitHub repo for your preferred stack:

* [Node / React / Next.js](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs/)
* [Python / Flask](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-python-flask)
* [PHP / Silex](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-php-silex)
* [Ruby / Sinatra](https://github.com/bigcommerce/hello-world-app-ruby-sinatra)
* [Laravel / React](https://github.com/bigcommerce/laravel-react-sample-app)
* [Node / FaunaDB / Netlify](https://github.com/bigcommerce/channels-app/)

## Testing locally with ngrok
You can use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to test apps locally. It's easy to install and works well with [Express](https://expressjs.com/):


```shell
npm install express-generator -g # install express generate

express myapp                    # generate new express app

cd myapp                         # move into app dir

npm install ngrok                # install ngrok

npm install                      # install dependencies

npm start                        # start app

ngrok http 3000                  # start ngrok
```

## Registering a draft app
Once you've exposed your app to the internet, you can register it as a draft app in the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/) using the app's callback URLs. Use the following steps to register:

1. [Sign in to the Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/).
2. Click **Create an App**.
3. Name your app.
4. Click **Technical**.
5. Enter your app's callback URLs. If you're using ngrok, they'll look like this:
   * **Auth**: `https://4022ffe4.ngrok.io/auth`
   * **Load**: `https://4022ffe4.ngrok.io/load`
   * **Uninstall**: `https://4022ffe4.ngrok.io/uninstall`
6.  Click **Update & Close**.
7.  Click **View Client ID** to view the app's `client_id` and `client_secret`.

## Installing a draft app
Any store registered to the same email as your [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) account can install your draft apps. Use the following steps to install:

1. Sign in to the store and navigate to **Apps** > **My Apps** > [**My Draft Apps**](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/marketplace/apps/my-apps/drafts).
2. Click the draft app thumbnail to install the draft. 
3. Once you click **Install**, BigCommerce will begin the OAauth flow by making a `GET` request to the app's `/auth` callback URL. If the app handles all the requests successfully, the app has been installed and you can begin feature development.
