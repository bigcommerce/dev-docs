# Deploy to Heroku install flow

To get the sample app up and running quickly, you can use the deploy to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) install flow described below. You will need a [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) account to use this flow. If you donâ€™t have a Heroku account, you can sign up for free [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

1. Fork the BigCommerce's [sample-app-nodejs](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs) repository.
2. In your fork, locate the `README.md` file. Click **Deploy to Heroku**. This will open Heroku's [Create New App](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) page in your browser.

3. You will be prompted to fill out app details. Give your app a name, then scroll down to Config Vars. Replace the `<APP NAME>` placeholder inside `AUTH_CALLBACK` with your app's name.
4. To obtain the Client ID and Client Secret, log into the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) and click **Create an app**.

14. Click **Update & Close**.
