# Quick Start: Deploy to Heroku Install Flow

If you want to skip the tutorial and get the app running quickly, you can use this install flow to deploy the sample app to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home). To create a Heroku account, visit the [Heroku signup page](https://signup.heroku.com/).

1. Fork the BigCommerce's [sample-app-nodejs](https://github.com/bigcommerce/sample-app-nodejs) repository.
2. In your fork, locate the `README.md` file. Click **Deploy to Heroku**. This will open Heroku's [Create New App](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) page in your browser.

3. When prompted, fill out your app details including giving your app a name.

4. Scroll down to **Config Vars** and replace the `<APP NAME>` placeholder inside `AUTH_CALLBACK` with your app's name.

5. To obtain the Client ID and Client Secret, sign in to the [Developer Portal](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps) and click **Create an app**.

6. Name your app and click **Create**.
7. **(Optional)** When prompted, fill out the details in the new window. You can also click **Close** to continue without entering information.
8. On the My Apps page, locate your newly created app and click **View Client ID**. This will open a new window displaying your Client ID and Client Secret.
9. Copy and paste your app's Client ID and Client Secret into your Heroku app.
10. Click **Deploy app** at the bottom of Heroku's Create New App page. Wait for the deploy script to finish running.

11. In the Developer Portal, click **Edit App**.
12. Open the **Technical** tab. In App Features, select STORE OWNER for **Multiple Users** and SINGLE-CLICK for **App Type**.
13. Scroll down to **Callback URLs** and update Auth, Load, and Uninstall URLs replacing placeholders with your Heroku app URL. For example, your Auth Callback should look similar to the following:  `https://heroku-sample-app.herokuapp.com/api/auth`.
14. Scroll down to OAuth scopes and set the **Products** access to MODIFY.
15. Click **Update & Close**.
16. In your sandbox store control panel, go to **Apps** > **My Apps** > **My Draft Apps**. Open your app and press **Install**. Click **Confirm**. This will install the app on your store. The installed app should look similar to the following:
