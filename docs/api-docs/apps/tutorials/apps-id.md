Select partners [building channel apps](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/channels/building-channel-apps) need to know their app's ID in order to create and modify the channel's configuration. This tutorial demonstrates how to find an app's ID in [DevTools](#find-in-devtools) and the [control panel](#find-in-control-panel).


## Find in Control Panel
An app's ID can be found in the URL while on the app's page in a store's control panel. The location of the app's page depends on if the app is installed or an uninstalled.
* **Uninstalled Draft Apps:** [**Apps** > **My Apps** > **My Draft Apps**](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/marketplace/apps/my-apps/drafts)
* **Installed Apps:** [**Apps** > **My Apps**](https://login.bigcommerce.com/deep-links/manage/marketplace/apps/my-apps)

To open the app page, click the app:

![Draft App](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/apps-id-01.png "Draft App")

The app ID is in the URL after `/manage/marketplace/apps/`:

![Draft App ID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/apps-id-02.png "Draft App ID")

## Find in DevTools

To find an app's ID in [DevTools](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps):
1. Login to [DevTools](https://devtools.bigcommerce.com/my/apps)
2. Click **Edit App**.

3. The app's ID is in the URL (Ex: `/my/apps/{{APP_ID}}/summary?review=false`)

## Usage

Once the app ID is obtained, it can be used to create or modify the `app` configuration for a channel via `POST` or `PUT` request to `/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/channels`:

```http
POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{STORE_HASH}}/v3/channels
X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
X-Auth-Client: {{CLIENT_ID}}
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

    "platform": "sales channel platform",
    "name": "name of the sales channel",

    "status": "connected‚Äù,
    "app": {

      "sections": [{

        "query_path": "overview"
       }, {
