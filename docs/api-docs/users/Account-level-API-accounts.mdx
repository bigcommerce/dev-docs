# Account-level API accounts

## Introduction
Account-level API accounts enable merchants to manage functions for multiple stores tied to your BigCommerce account. When a token is generated it will belong to the account that the merchant has logged into. 

With account-level credentials merchants can now perform actions at scale such as:
* Facilitate onboarding or offboarding processes for a group of users
* Run user reports to compile records for compliance or other purposes 
* Manage subscriptions and other recurring offerings to users on an enterprise level

<Callout type="info">
 As long as this account is active, the token will always be tied to the account.
</Callout>

Before you get started creating account-level tokens, read our doc on [API Accounts & OAuth Scopes](api-docs/getting-started/api-accounts) to get up to speed.

## How it works
After an account-level API token is created, merchants can now add a layer of protection when making API calls to our API gateway. Once the call is made, the BigCommerce gateway checks for authorization by sending the request through to Authorization and Authentication to confirm that the token has the required permissions.
