# Account-level API accounts

## Introduction
Account-level API tokens enable merchants to manage account-level permissions per BigCommerce account. When generated, this newly created token will belong to the account that merchant has logged into. 

<Callout type="info">
 As long as this account is active, the token will always be tied to the account and not the user who created it.
</Callout>

Before you get started creating account-level tokens, read our doc on [API Accounts & OAuth Scopes](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/getting-started/api-accounts).
