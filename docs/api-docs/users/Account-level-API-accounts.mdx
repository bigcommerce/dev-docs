# Account-level API accounts

## Introduction
Account-level API accounts enable merchants to manage functions for multiple stores tied to your BigCommerce account. When a token is generated it will belong to the account that the merchant has logged into. 

With account-level credentials merchants can now perform actions at scale such as:
* Facilitate onboarding or offboarding processes for a group of users
* Run user reports to compile records for compliance or other purposes 
* Manage subscriptions and other recurring offerings to users on an enterprise level

<Callout type="info">
 As long as this account is active, the token will always be tied to the account.
</Callout>

Before you get started creating account-level tokens, read our doc on [API Accounts & OAuth Scopes](api-docs/getting-started/api-accounts) to get up to speed.
