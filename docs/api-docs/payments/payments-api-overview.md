The Payments API enables you to process payments through the store’s connected payment gateway. A payment can be taken for an order that is created using either the [Server to Server Checkout API Orders](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-checkout-api) endpoint or creating an order using [V2 Orders](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api/orders/createanorder) endpoint.

Payments are processed via a sequence of requests to two API hosts:
* Create the payment token:   `https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/v3/payments/access_tokens`
* Process the payment:   `https://payments.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/payments`

### Required [OAuth Scopes](/api-docs/getting-started/authentication#authentication_oauth-scopes)**
* `Create` `Payments`
* `Read` `Payment Methods`

## PCI Compliance

BigCommerce is only responsible for the security of credit card to the extent that it is directly in the route of the payment request to payment processors during a payment processing request. To ensure secure handling of payment instruments, as a third-party developer, you are responsible for developing the storefronts or recurring billing apps in a PCI compliant manner and maintaining a PCI compliance certification for third-party service providers certified by an external Qualified Security Assessor (QSA).

Merchants or shoppers personal identifiable information (PII) collected by recurring billing apps that consumes the BigCommerce Payments API must have it’s own Privacy Policy sufficient to the requirements of the European Union General Data Protection Requirements (GDPR) which must be available and displayed to the general public.

## Stored Cards
There are three steps to using a stored card to make a payment.

1. [Get Payment Methods](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-methods/paymentsmethodsget)
2. [Create Access Token](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost)
3. [Process Payment](/api-reference/payments/payments-process-payments/payment/paymentspost)

To use stored cards with the Payments API or the Checkout SDK make sure stored cards are enabled in the stores Control Panel. To enable stored credit cards on your storefront, navigate to **Store Setup › Payments** and click the tab for your payment gateway. Toggle the switch to enable Stored Credit Cards and Save. For more on enabling stored cards, see [Enabling Stored Credit Cards](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Enabling-Stored-Credit-Cards).

**Requirements for Stored Cards**

* Your store must be on a Plus plan or higher.
* Your store needs to be using Optimized One-Page Checkout.
* Your store needs to be using a compatible payment gateway.

1. To pay with a stored card, first make a call to [Get Payment Methods](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-methods/paymentsmethodsget) for the `stored_instruments > token`. The `order_id` is passed in as a query parameter.

This token is the same as `payment_instrument_token` from [Get Transactions](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-transactions-api).

          "is_default": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "meta": {}
}
```

Make note of the `token` to use as part of processing the payment in the request body.

### Create Access Token
2. Make a request to [Create Access Token](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost) to get the authorization token that needs to be passed in the header when processing the payment. The ID of the order needs to be part of the request body.

  },
  "meta": {}
}
```

### Process the Payment
3. To process the payment, send a POST to [Process Payment](/api-reference/payments/payments-process-payments/payment/paymentspost). You will need the following information from [Get Payment Methods](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-methods/paymentsmethodsget) in step one.

**Get Payment Methods = Process Payment**
* type = type
* token = token
* last_four = verfication_value
* id = payment_method_id

The headers to process a payment are different than the headers you normally send with a BigCommerce API. The Authorization token is the ID that is returned in Get Payment Access Token (step two).

**Headers**
* Accept: application/vnd.bc.v1+json
* Authorization: PAT {your-access-token}
* Content-Type: application/json

    "transaction_type": "purchase"
  }
}
```

If the purchase was successful it will return a status of success. The order is then automatically moved to an Awaiting Fulfillment status. If you get a different response, see [Error Codes](#error-codes) for troubleshooting.

## Credit Cards

There are two steps to using a credit card to make a payment.

1. [Create Access Token](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost)
2. [Process Payment](/api-reference/payments/payments-process-payments/payment/paymentspost)

### Create Access Token
1. Make a request to [Create Access Token](/api-reference/payments/payments-create-payment-token-api/payment-access-token/paymentsaccesstokenspost) to to get the authorization token that needs to be passed in the header when processing the payment. The ID of the order needs to be part of the request body.

### Process the Payment

2. To process the payment, send a POST to [Process Payment](/api-reference/payments/payments-process-payments/payment/paymentspost).

The headers to process a payment are different than the headers you normally send with a BigCommerce API. The Authorization token is the ID that is returned in Get Payment Access Token(step two).

**Headers**
* Accept: application/vnd.bc.v1+json
* Authorization: PAT {your-access-token}
* Content-Type: application/json

Send the request with the following fields from the credit card:
* type -- Will always be card
* payment_method_id -- The name of the card in the format `payment-provider.card`
* number
* cardholder_name
* expiry_month
* expiry_year
* verification_value

If any of these fields are incorrect, the payment might be rejected.

```

If the purchase was successful it will return a status of success. The order is then automatically moved to an Awaiting Fulfillment status. If you get a different response, see [Error Codes](#error-codes) for troubleshooting.

### Storing Credit Cards

Payments API allows developers to store a credit card while processing a credit card payment.

When processing a credit payment set `save_instrument: true`. The shopper can also store credit cards during checkout. If you are using the [Checkout SDK](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/cart-and-checkout/checkout-sdk), it can store the credit card as part of the checkout.

*`POST`* `https://payments.bigcommerce.com/stores/{store_hash}/payments`

**Process payment example POST**

```json
{
  "payment": {
    "instrument": {
      "type": "card",
      "number": "4111111111111111",
      "cardholder_name": "BP",
      "expiry_month": 12,
      "expiry_year": 2020,
      "verification_value": "411"
    },
    "payment_method_id": "authorizenet.card",
    "save_instrument": true
  }
}
```

## Using the Orders API

It is possible to take a payment for an order created using the [Orders API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-docs/orders/orders-api-overview). When creating the order using the Orders API make sure the `status_id:0`. If the order status is not created with the status set to `0` or `Incomplete`, the Payments API will return an [error](#error-codes).
The billing address and line items should be filled in when creating the order. The order can be created as a guest order by either seeting the
`customer_id:0`or leaving it blank. After the order is created, then follow the steps for either a [credit card](#payments_credit-cards) or a [stored card](#payments_stored-cards).

## Technical Details

### Using Test Credit Cards

The following is a list of supported gateways and a list of their test credit cards. These can be useful while getting your app setup. Check your credit card setup in both [BigCommerce](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Online-Payment-Methods#setup) and the payment gateway to make sure testing is configured properly. If the credit cards do not work or stop working please reach out the payment provider as these are not maintained by BigCommerce.

* [Authorize.Net](https://developer.authorize.net/hello_world/testing_guide/)
* [Paypal Powered by Braintree](https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/credit-cards/testing-go-live/php)
* [CyberSource](https://www.cybersource.com/developers/other_resources/quick_references/test_cc_numbers/)
* [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#cards)

### Token
The `payment_access_token` is not from the payment provider. It is created by BigCommerce.

### Decline Payments
If a payment is declined it will return a 4XX error with details if available.

### Authorization
If a payment gateway is configured for authorization only, the payment will be authorized at the time of processing. The order will have to later be captured through the control panel. If the gateway is set for authorization and capture, the payment will be authorized and captured when payment is processed.

### Control Panel
Orders created and captured via the API will look the same as other orders created via the storefront or other apps. The order source will be “Checkout API.”

### Data Access
The card data is not accessible via the API once the payment is processed.

### Rate Limits
The Payments API rate limit is 50 payment requests per 4 seconds.  Some payment providers will provide checks on the incoming requests.


## Sample App Diagram

The following diagram shows how the `payment_access_token` interacts with BigCommerce API and BigCommerce payments.

Orders can be created using the [Server to Server API Endpoints](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/cart-checkout/server-server-checkout-api/checkout-orders/createanorder) or [Orders API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/orders/orders-api).

## FAQ

**How do I get a list of stored credit cards?**

Use the Get Payment Methods to get a list of stored payment instruments. 

**Can I add my payment gateway?**

The Payments API does not support adding a third party gateway. Payments are processed through BigCommerce.

**Can I issue a refund?**

Refunds can be issued either using the [Control Panel](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Processing-Refunds) or through the payment gateway directly.

**How do I process payment for a capture credit card?**

Once a payment has been authorized, the capture step will need to be completed using the [Control Panel](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/How-can-I-set-my-payment-gateway-to-only-authorize-transactions-and-not-capture-the-funds-automatically).

**Can I use this on orders with more than one shipping address?**
Yes, checkouts and orders with more than one consignment can use the Payments API.

**Is store credit supported?**

Store credit is not a supported payment method with the Payments API. Store credit can still be used by the shopper on the storefront, part of the control panel or with the Checkout API.

**Are gift certificates supported?**

The Payment Processing API is for processing payments through a store's payment gateway. Since BigCommerce store gift cards are not processed through a payment gateway, they can not be processed through via the Payment Processing API.

**Are offline payment methods supported?**
The Payments API is designed to process credit card payments through supported payment gateways; it does not expose methods for processing [offline payment methods](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Offline-Payment-Methods) such as cash on delivery.
