# Deprecations and Sunsets

This article provides a reference for deprecated APIs and exposes BigCommerce's plans to sunset specific API operations and properties. We recommend setting up a feed alert for our [Developer Changelog](/release-notes) to receive the most up-to-date information about API changes. For more information on how to set up a feed alert, see [changelog](/docs/start/about/support#changelog).

## Deprecations

The following APIs, features, and tools are deprecated. We discourage using these listed items, as BigCommerce either no longer supports them or won't be providing additional support or new features. Instead, consider using the suggested replacements.

| Deprecated API or feature | Replacement |
|:--------------------------|:------------|
| `/v2/brands` | [Catalog V3 Brands](/docs/rest-catalog/brands#get-all-brands) |
| `/v3/content/widgets/search` | [Widgets V3, Get all widgets](/docs/rest-content/widgets/widget#get-all-widgets) |
| `/v2/categories` | [Catalog V3 Catalog Trees - Categories](/docs/rest-catalog/category-trees/categories#get-all-categories) |
| `/v3/catalog/categories` | [Catalog V3 Catalog Trees - Categories](/docs/rest-catalog/category-trees/categories#get-all-categories) |
| `/v2/customers` | [Customers V3](/docs/rest-management/customers) |
| `/v3/hooks/events`| [Get Events](/docs/webhooks/webhooks/webhook-events#get-events) |
| `/v2/options` | [Catalog V3 Product Modifiers](/docs/rest-catalog/product-modifiers#get-all-product-modifiers), [Catalog V3 Product Variant Options](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variant-options#get-all-product-variant-options). See the [Accessing product options](#accessing-product-options-with-V3) callout. |
| `/v2/option_sets` | [Catalog V3 Product Modifiers](/docs/rest-catalog/product-modifiers#get-all-product-modifiers), [Catalog V3 Product Variant Options](/docs/rest-catalog/product-variant-options#get-all-product-variant-options). The `option_sets` endpoint is intentionally not available in the V3 Catalog API. For more information, see [V2 vs V3 Catalog APIs](/docs/store-operations/catalog/migration). |
| `/v2/pages` | [Pages V3](/docs/rest-content/pages) |
| `/v2/products ` | [Catalog V3 Products](/docs/rest-catalog/products#get-all-products) |
| `/v2/redirects` | [Redirects V3](/docs/rest-management/redirects) |

<Callout type="info">
  #### Accessing product options with V3
  In V3, `modifiers` attach directly to products and `options` attach to variants. Use `options` and `modifiers` together to access the contents of the former V2 `options` response.
</Callout>

### Product tools

We no longer support the following general product tools.

| Deprecated tool | Support end date |
|:----------------|:-----------------|
