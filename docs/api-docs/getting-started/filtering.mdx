# Filtering

To filter collections down to a particular set of items, you can add filters to your request as URL query parameters.

The maximum number of products returned is 250. Viewing more products requires creating a script that can loop through each subsequent page.

These are the most common filter options available for the REST Management API:

| Operator | Expression  | Example |
|--|--|--|
| Equals/equivalency | attribute=value  | `/v3/catalog/products?price=10` `/v3/catalog/products?name=My Product` |
| Greater than or equal to (for numbers or dates) | attribute:min=value  | `/v3/catalog/products?price:min=10` |
| Less than or equal to (for numbers or dates) | attribute:max=value | `/v3/catalog/products?price:max=10` |
| Greater than (for numbers or dates)| attribute:greater=value | `/v3/catalog/products?price:greater=10` |
| Less than (for numbers or dates) | attribute:less=value | `/v3/catalog/products?price:less=10` |
| SQL LIKE operator (for strings) | attribute:like=pattern | `/v3/catalog/categories?name:like=Shirts` |
| SQL IN operator (for arrays) | attribute:in=csv,list of values | `/v3/catalog/products?categories:in=123,456` |
| SQL NOT IN operator (for arrays) | attribute:not_in=csv,list of values | `/v3/catalog/products?categories:not_in=123,456` |

Available filters vary by endpoint. For up-to-date information on supported filters, refer to the `GET` method documentation of each endpoint.

## Include

Certain endpoints support the `include` query parameter used to include sub-resources and specific attributes in the primary `GET` response for a parent object. For example, you can include a product's variants and images with the product response:

`/v3/catalog/products?include=variants,images`

The availability of the `include` query parameter varies by endpoint. For up-to-date filter information, refer to the `GET` method documentation of each endpoint.

For more information about whether an endpoint supports the `include` parameter, consult the API reference for the endpoint in question.

## Include and exclude fields

Many of BigCommerce's REST API endpoints support both `include_fields` and `exclude_fields` query parameters.

- `include_fields` query parameter will return ONLY the specified fields in the response.
- `exclude_fields` query parameter will omit the specified fields from the response.

You can request any field that is available on the object. Speed up your API request response time by excluding unnecessary fields from your request, especially large fields like descriptions.

The following example shows product name and price included in a single request:

```http filename="Example response: Product name and price" showLineNumbers copy
GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products?include_fields=name,price

{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 77,
            "name": "Red printed scarf",
            "price": 12
        }
    ]
}
```

The availability of the `include_fields` and `exclude_fields` query parameters varies by endpoint. For up-to-date filter information, refer to the `GET` method documentation of each endpoint.

## Pagination and limit

* `page` is the number of pages that are returned by the API.
* `limit` is the number of results per page that are returned.
* `page=2&limit=10` will return page 2 of the results with 10 items per page.
