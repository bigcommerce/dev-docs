# Filtering

<div class="otp" id="no-index">

### On This Page
- [Includes](#includes)
- [Pagination and Limit](#pagination-and-limit)

</div>

To filter collections down to a particular set of items, you can add filters to your request as URL query parameters.

The maximum number of products returned is 250. Viewing more products requires creating a script that can loop through each subsequent page.


These are the most common filter options available for the V3 API: 

| Operator | Expression  | Example | 
|--|--|--|
| Equals/equivalency | attribute=value  | `/v3/catalog/products?price=10` `/v3/catalog/products?name=My Product` |
| Greater than or equal to (for numbers or dates) | attribute:min=value  | `/v3/catalog/products?price:min=10` |
| Less than or equal to (for numbers or dates) | attribute:max=value | `/v3/catalog/products?price:max=10` |
| Greater than (for numbers or dates)| attribute:greater=value | `/v3/catalog/products?price:greater=10` |
| Less than (for numbers or dates) | attribute:less=value | `/v3/catalog/products?price:less=10` |
| SQL LIKE operator (for strings) | attribute:like=pattern | `/v3/catalog/categories?name:like=Shirts` |
| SQL IN operator (for arrays) | attribute:in=csv,list,of,values | `/v3/catalog/products?categories:in=123,456` |
| SQL NOT IN operator (for arrays) | attribute:not_in=csv,list,of,values | `/v3/catalog/products?categories:not_in=123,456` |

Available filters vary by endpoint. Refer to the GET method for an endpoint to see a list of available filters.

## Includes

Some endpoints allow `?include` parameter to include sub-resources and other information in the primary GET response for a parent object.

These endpoints allow you to save API calls by getting more information in a response. However, it may slow down your response.

For example, you can include a product's variants and images with the product response: `/v3/catalog/products?include=variants,images`

The availability of the `?include` parameter varies by endpoint. Refer to the `GET` method for an endpoint to see a list of available fields.


### Including and Excluding Fields

Some endpoints support both `?include_fields` and `?exclude_fields`. 

`include_fields` will return ONLY the specified fields in the response. `exclude_fields` will omit the specified fields from the response.

You can specify any field that is available on the object. Excluding fields you don't care about (especially large fields like descriptions) can speed up your API request response time.

**Example Response Get Product Name and Price**  
Here, product name and price information are in the endpoint:

`https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/products?include_fields=name,price`

<!--
title: "Product Name and Price"
subtitle: ""
lineNumbers: true
-->

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": 77,
            "name": "Red printed scarf",
            "price": 12
        }    
    ]
} 
```

## Pagination and Limit

`?page` is the number of pages that are returned via api.

`?limit` is the number of results per page that are returned.

`page=2&limit=10`
This will return page 2 of the results with 10 items per page.
