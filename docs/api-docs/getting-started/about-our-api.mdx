# About Our APIs

The BigCommerce suite of APIs empowers you to create apps, automate store processes, and build headless ecommerce solutions. 

If you're new to building BigCommerce apps, we recommend that you start by exploring the [App Marketplace](https://www.bigcommerce.com/apps/) to get a feel for what's possible. 

When you're ready to play with our APIs, check out the [API Request Quick Start](/api-docs/getting-started/basics/making-requests). 

## Available APIs
BigCommerce has several APIs that let you manage store data, authenticate customers, make client-side queries for product information, and more.

### REST Store Management APIs
BigCommerce's Store Management and Payment APIs (for example, the [Catalog API](/docs/rest-catalog)) allow you to manage transactions, modify store data, and act as store administrator. Example use cases include the following:
* Add and update products in a store
* Update a customer's order and change the order status
* Create a coupon
* Manage a customer's store account details

### REST Storefront API
The [REST Storefront API](/docs/rest-storefront/carts) allows you to manage customer carts, checkouts, and order information client-side. Example use cases include the following:
* Add an item with JavaScript to a shopper's cart from a Stencil storefront
* Programmatically retrieve and display information to a customer about their recent order
* Update the billing address of a checkout
* Clear a customer's current cart


### GraphQL Storefront API
BigCommerce's [GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/graphql-storefront) allows you to query products, customers, carts and launch a checkout on a headless storefront or from a store's frontend. Example use cases include the following:
* Request product data from your browser into a Stencil theme
* Access customer data on the frontend of a site
* Fetch category and brand details from a store's frontend

### Customer Login API
The [Customer Login API](/api-docs/storefront/customer-login-api) lets you programmatically sign customers in to a BigCommerce storefront. Example use cases include the following:
* Sign customers in to a BigCommerce store from a third-party account or a headless storefront
* Enable login using credentials other than email and password, such as a phone number
* Integrate a BigCommerce store with an SSO provider


### Current Customer API
BigCommerce's [Current Customer API](/api-docs/customers/current-customer-api) allows you to determine which customer is logged in to a storefront during a session.
* Confirm a customer's identity in the browser
* Validate a customer's identity to display specific information to them from an external app 


## API authentication and context

## Anatomy of REST Store Management APIs

The following sections describe the configuration of well-formed requests and responses to and from BigCommerce-hosted REST APIs.

### Media types

A media type is the format of the request or response body. BigCommerce APIs accept requests and send responses in JSON. Encode requests using the UTF-8 character set; other character sets can have unpredictable results.

### Requests

#### Request headers

Store Management and Payments API requests require the `Accept`, `X-Auth-Token`, and `Content-Type` headers.

| Header | Allowed Values | Description | Example |
|:-------|:---------------|:------------|:--------|
| `Accept` | `application/json` (for .json requests) `application/xml` (for .xml requests) | The MIME type format for receiving a response.|`application/xml` |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` (for JSON requests) `application/xml` (for XML requests) | The MIME type of the request body. Used to validate and parse the request to the API. | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | String | While it is not required, we ask that you specify a user agent which identifies your integration/client with your requests. |
| `X-Auth-Token` | String | Access token authorizing the app to access resources on behalf of a user. |

#### Request content type
When performing a request that contains a body, specify the type of content you are sending with the `Content-Type` header. This typically applies to `PUT` and `POST` requests.

#### Request structure
The body of a JSON request is an object containing a set of key-value pairs. A simple representation of a product object is:

```json filename="Example request body: Product object" showLineNumbers copy
{
 "id": 5,
 "name": "iPod",
 "description": "A portable MP3 music player."
}
```

### Responses

#### Response headers

HTTP response header names are case-insensitive; see the [HTTP specification on field names](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-field-names) for more information. For example, your application may receive `x-rate-limit-requests-left` rather than `X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left`, so plan your implementation accordingly. Most open source HTTP clients treat headers with the appropriate case insensitivity. 


| Header | Possible Values | Description | Example |
|:-------|:----------------|:------------|:--------|
| `Date` | An <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.3" target="_blank">RFC 2822</a> date. | The date the response was sent. | `Tue, 15 Nov 2011 12:45:26 GMT` |
| `last-modified` | An <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.3" target="_blank">RFC 2822</a> date. | The date the resource was last modified. Please refer to the individual resource pages for support for this header. | `Tue, 15 Nov 2011 12:45:26 GMT` |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | The MIME type of the response, dependent on the extension of the endpoint that was requested. | `application/json` |
| `Content-Location` | A URI | Sent if the request was redirected. | `/api/v2/orders/5.json` |
| `Location` | A URI | The URI of a newly created resource. Sent with a `201 Created` response. | `/api/v2/products/7` |
| `X-Retry-After` | integer | Rate limited response, indicating the number of seconds before the quota refreshes. See [Rate Limits](/api-docs/getting-started/best-practices#api-rate-limits) for more information. | `15` |
| `X-BC-ApiLimit-Remaining` | integer | The number of API requests remaining for the current period (rolling one hour). See [Rate Limits](/api-docs/getting-started/best-practices#api-rate-limits) for more information. | `987` |
| `X-BC-Store-Version` | A version number | The version of BigCommerce on which the store is running. This header is available on versions 7.3.6+. | ` 7.3.6` |
| `Content-Encoding` | `gzip` | Allows API clients to request content to be compressed before being sent back in the response to an API request. | `gzip` |
| `Transfer-Encoding` | `chunked` | Specifies the form of encoding used to transfer the resource. | `chunked`
| `X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left` | number | Details how many remaining requests your client can make in the current window before being rate-limited. In this case, you would expect to be able to make 6 more requests in the next 3000 milliseconds; on the 7th request within 3000 milliseconds, you would be rate-limited and would receive an HTTP 429 response. | `16101491` |
| `X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Quota` | number | Shows how many API requests are allowed in the current window for your client. | `16101495` |
| `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms` | number | Shows how many milliseconds are remaining in the window. In this case, 3000 milliseconds – so, 3000 milliseconds after this request, the API quota will be refreshed. |`30000 `|
| `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Window-Ms` | number | Shows the size of your current rate-limiting window. | `9762` |

#### Response content type
When requesting a resource that returns a body, specify the type of content you want to receive with the `Accept` header. Alternatively, you can supply an extension to the resource you're requesting.

The priorities with which you can process these methods are:
* Accept header high-priority types (eg. `Accept: application/json`) extensions on the resource (e.g. `customers.json`).
* Accept header low priority types (priorities less than 1, e.g. `Accept: application/json;q=0.9`)

### Request Structure
The body of a JSON request is an object containing a set of key-value pairs. A simple representation of a product object is:

```http filename="Example JSON request body" showLineNumbers copy
{
 "id": 5,
 "name": "iPod",
 "description": "A portable MP3 music player."
}
```

### Response structure
Responses are structured similarly to requests. If a request returns a single object, then the response will contain a single object containing the fields for that resource.

```http filename="Example request: Get a category"
GET https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/catalog/categories/{{category_id}}
```


```json filename="Example response: Get a category" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "data": {
    "id": 39,
    "parent_id": 19,
    "name": "Bath",
    "description": "",
    "views": 0,
    "sort_order": 0,
    "page_title": "",
    "meta_keywords": [
      ""
    ],
    "meta_description": "",
    "layout_file": "category.html",
    "image_url": "",
    "is_visible": true,
    "search_keywords": "",
    "default_product_sort": "use_store_settings",
    "custom_url": {
      "url": "/garden/bath/",
      "is_customized": false
    }
  },
  "meta": {}
}
```
