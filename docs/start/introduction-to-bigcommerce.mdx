# Introduction to BigCommerce

It all starts with **purpose**.

✨ We’re here to _open commerce_. ✨

We open up the possibilities of commerce for brands and retailers throughout their journeys, and we openly collaborate with the broader commerce ecosystem to create opportunities for mutual growth.

## What is BigCommerce?

We’re a commerce-centric company, platform, and set of retailer-facing SaaS products used to scale ecommerce businesses:

**Commerce-centric company**

We’re innovators in the commerce landscape. A NASDAQ-listed, publicly traded company, we empower brands and retailers to grow at all stages of their development, across every sales channel.

**Commerce platform**

From store-level APIs that handle product catalogs, orders, and customers to shopper-focused APIs that help you craft perfect storefront experiences, our platform can power almost any commerce experience you can imagine. The products we offer are all powered by our platform, and our [developer-focused starter projects](/tools-resources) give examples of what’s possible. You’re in the right place to learn about everything our platform can do!

**Commerce products for brands**

Our hosted control panel and bundled storefront are how most brands interact with BigCommerce. They have access to their BigCommerce stores from day one. And when those businesses need more? That’s when developers like you step in, building single-click apps that enrich their control panels with new functionality. Hundreds of apps available in our marketplace do just that, and thousands of agencies support brands as they further customize their storefronts.

We deliver our core platform and products using a SaaS model. We continually enhance our stores with feature, performance, and security updates. We take pride in handling these mission-critical updates for the brands we serve. An ever-expanding set of certifications demonstrate the performance and reliability of our platform, including PCI, ISO, SOC, FIPS, RH-ISAC, GDPR, and CCPA.

## What makes BigCommerce unique?

We strive to open commerce through our open SaaS approach, blending the flexibility of open source with the usability and security of SaaS. It means developers and retailers get a powerhouse commerce platform without the constraints of a SaaS monolith.

We think BigCommerce is the most welcoming, open SaaS commerce platform out there, both technologically and on a human level. Our partners, agencies, and the developers that work with them are always top of mind, because we believe that great ideas can come from outside. We think it’s key to build the future of commerce _together_, and you’ll see us operate with that mindset every day.
