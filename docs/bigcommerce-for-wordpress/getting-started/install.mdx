## Installation

To install BigCommerce for WordPress, you will need to [install and activate the plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/bigcommerce/) in WordPress and connect your BigCommerce account. If you do not already have an account, you will be prompted to create one.

For a walkthrough on installing and activating the plugin, see [Using BigCommerce for WordPress](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-for-WordPress#installation) (BigCommerce Help Center).

## Setting your channel name

Once connected, you will set up a new [channel name](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/BigCommerce-for-WordPress#installation). This name will be used to identify this specific WordPress instance in BigCommerce when checking orders or listing products.

### Multisite Instructions

For multisite instructions, see [Multisite Setup](/docs/storefront/wordpress/start/multi-site).

After you have created your new channel name, the initial product sync will begin and you can begin configuring your plugin settings.
