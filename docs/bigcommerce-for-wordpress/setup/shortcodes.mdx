# Shortcodes

Most of the plugin's functionality is exposed on the front-end of the site through shortcodes embedded on automatically created pages. The code controlling those shortcodes can be found in the classes in `src/BigCommerce/Shortcodes`.

## Products Shortcode

`[bigcommerce_product]`

The product shortcode can be used to include one or more products on other pages or posts on the WordPress site. Click the **Add Products** button above the editor to select products or build a dynamic query to include in the page.

While the shortcode can be built using the button, it can also be created manually. It accepts a number of optional attributes:

|Attribute|Expected Value|Example|
|-|-|-|
|`id`|A comma delimited list of BigCommerce product IDs        |`[bigcommerce_product id="11,13"]`|
|`post_id`|A comma delimited list of WordPress product post IDs|`[bigcommerce_product post_id="12,22"]`|
|`sku`|A comma delimited list of BigCommerce product SKUs|`[bigcommerce_product sku="ex44,ex47"]`|
|`category`|A comma delimited list of Product Category slugs|`[bigcommerce_product category="tee_shirts,pants"]`|
|`brand`| A comma delimited list of Brand slugs|`[bigcommerce_product brand="sony,rca"]`|
|`featured`|Set to 1 to limit the query to featured products  |`[bigcommerce_product featured="1"]`|
|`recent`|Set to 1 to limit the query to products imported in the last 2 days |`[bigcommerce_product recent="1"]`|
|`sale`|Set to 1 to limit the query to sale products|`[bigcommerce_product sale="1"]`|
|`search`|A search string to match against product titles, BigCommerce product IDs, or SKUs|`[bigcommerce_product search="CoolProduct Title"]`|
|`paged`| Set to 0 to disable pagination  |`[bigcommerce_product paged="0"]`|
|`per_page`|The number of products to show per page. Defaults to the value set in the theme customizer|`[bigcommerce_product per_page="12"]`|
|`order`|Whether to sort products in "ASC" or "DESC" order|`[bigcommerce_product order="ASC"]`|
|`orderby`|Which field to use for sorting. Accepts any field that WP_Query accepts (e.g., title, date)|`[bigcommerce_product orderby="title"]`|

## Component Shortcodes

`[bc-component]`

The component shortcode lets you include an attribute for a particular product in pages and posts across your WordPress site. Within the Block Editor, click the plus symbol on the area of the page you want to add the component to and select BigCommerce Product Components. This creates a Gutenburg block containing a product's information. You must specify a Product ID, then select the product component you'd like to display.

You can build the shortcode using the Block Editor, or it can be created manually. It accepts a number of attributes:

|Attribute|Expected Value|Example|
|-|-|-|
|`sku`|The product's base SKU|`[bc-component id="163" type="SKU"]`|
|`image`|The product's feature image|`[bc-component id="163" type="image"]`|
|`title`|The product's title|`[bc-component id="163" type="title"]`|
|`description`|The product's description|`[bc-component id="163" type="description"]`|
|`add_to_cart`| Displays an add-to-cart button for the product |`[bc-component id="163" type="add_to_cart"]`|

## Other Shortcodes
