# Product Import

Products are imported from the BigCommerce API on a [WordPress cron job](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/cron/), or using a WP-CLI command: `wp bigcommerce import products`

The import runs in several stages:
<Steps>
### Queue product list
A list of all products from the API is added to a queue for processing.
### Remove Out of Stock items
Any products on the site that are no longer available in the BigCommerce store are marked for deletion.
### Working the queue
The queue is processed in chunks (five items at a time), whereby products are imported, updated, or deleted to match the data in BigCommerce.
### Settings update
Currency and other store information from the API updates settings in WordPress.
