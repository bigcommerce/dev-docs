# Troubleshooting BigCommerce for WordPress Plugin

Find solutions to some unexpected issues encountered when using the BigCommerce for WordPress plugin. 

## Error on "Add to Cart" button, 404 error

If you encounter an error on the "Add to Cart" button, or get the message below, try resetting the site's redirects.

```shell showLineNumbers copy
Not Found: The requested URL /bigcommerce/cart/42 was not found on this server.
Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request.
```
To reset the site's redirects use the following steps:

1. Make changes in WordPress by going to **Settings > Permalinks**. 
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Save**. This button resets the site's redirects.

## PHP getenv() Errors

When the plugin floods the error log with the following message:

```shell showLineNumbers copy
PHP message: PHP Warning: getenv() expects exactly 1 parameter, 2 given in wp-content/plugins/bigcommerce-for-wordpress-0.11.1/bigcommerce.php on line 58
```

This message appears if you're running on PHP version 5.4 or lower. The plugin requires 5.6+ or higher to function properly. 

## 403 error on API request

When sending an API request and you get a 403 error, or encounter the following message:

```txt showLineNumbers copy
[429] Error connecting to the API (https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/hash/v3/catalog/categories?id%3Ain=138%2C139%2C140%2C142%2C143%2C144%2C145%2C146%2C147%2C149&limit=10&include_fields=id)
```

Ensure that either the server or service isn't blocking requests. 

<Callout type="info">
  Be sure to whitelist requests to the BigCommerce API and the responses from it.
</Callout>

## Could not retrieve the token

There are API scope issues if you get the error below:

```shell showLineNumbers copy

}
```

When using the `Fast` (headless) import, apply the right scopes to your API keys. The Storefront API tokens, and Storefront API impersonation token, scopes are required. Create a new token with the correct scopes by going to **Dashboard > Settings > Store-level API accounts**.

## Mini-cart/cart page doesn't render or the wrong amount of products appear

Check to see if this is a cache problem. Each time you add a product to a cart, an API request is sent. Without a cache set, the cart's content updates after successfully processing of the API request. However, if you apply cache rules, they can affect the cart and return the wrong version of the cart (e.g., empty cart page, not a sufficient amount of products, etc.). 

To resolve the issue, exclude the cart page and mini-cart requests from the cache.

## Sync stuck. No handler found for the current import state

If your product sync is stuck or if you've come across the message below, there are steps available to get things back in sync.

```shell showLineNumbers copy
BigCommerce.NOTICE: No handler found for current import state {"state":"completed"}
```

The following steps will get your products syncing once again.

1. Go to **wp-admin > BigCommerce > Settings > Diagnostics**. 
2. Click the **Abort import button** and wait one to two minutes. 
3. Now try to restart the import. Check to see if WP-Cron is working and if there aren't any server issues. 

<Callout type="info">
  If the import still doesn't work, contact BigCommerce support and/or create an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/issues). Be sure to provide as many details as possible.
</Callout>

## PHP errors in server logs related to the plugin

If you encounter the following PHP errors (shown below) in your server logs related to the plugin, then extension-related issues could be the problem. 

```shell showLineNumbers
PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function BigCommerce\Import\Importers\Products\ctype_alpha() in path/wp-content/plugins/bigcommerce/src/BigCommerce/Import/Importers/Products/Product_Builder.php:461 
```

First, check that this is not a PHP extension specific issue, e.g https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ctype-alpha.php (function is disabled by hosting/service provider and similar.) If that doesn't resolve the issue, contact BigCommerce support, or create an issue in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/issues).

## Not all products from the BigCommerce store appear on the WordPress site

If products are missing in the WordPress control panel, verify that the products are assigned to the corresponding channels. Make sure that the `Automatic Listing` option for `Full` import isn't disabled in the plugin's settings.

## Import is too slow

The import time depends on the number of products that you have synced from your catalog. In general, if you have more than 200 products and use `Full` import,  then it is normal for the import to run for more than 30 minutes. 

Note that the import process also relies on WP-Cron. Import tasks are processed only when the site has visitors. To avoid this kind of issue follow the [Server Side Cron](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/extending-the-plugin/creating-reliable-cron-jobs#using-server-cron-to-enhance-wp-cron) guide.

## Inactive channel. Product import canceled

If the product import is canceled, or you see the following error below, make sure your channel is properly connected.

```shell showLineNumbers copy
[502] Error connecting to the API (https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/hash/v3/channels/channel_id/listings)
[504] Error connecting to the API (https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/hash/v3/channels/channel_id/listings/listing_id)
```

Check that your WordPress store is connected to BigCommerce and that you set the primary channel under **BigCommerce > Settings > Channel**. If you did not set the primary channel, re-install the plugin and connect it to the correct store channel.

## Webhooks incorrect password

If you see the following webhook error below, try resetting the webhooks in the BigCommerce control panel.

```shell showLineNumbers copy
BigCommerce-webhooks.ERROR: Incoming webhook password does not match
```

Use the following steps to reset the webhook settings:
 
1. Go to **BigCommerce > Settings > Product Sync**. 
2. Disable webhooks and save settings. 
3. After the page reloads, go to the **BigCommerce > Settings > Product Sync** again and re-enable webhooks.

## Cart/Checkout URL doesn't work or gives a 404 error

If you get a 404 error, or are confronting an issue with the URL, you can fix this in the WordPress control panel. Be sure to set the correct permalink structure in **wp-admin > Settings > Permalinks**. For correct plugin work, enable any permalink structure except a plain one.

## Password reset email doesn't work

If the reset password email doesn't appear in your inbox, check that your server/service isn't blocking it. Also, check that the email functionality is on. The plugin relies on the settings set in WordPress.

## Some elements are hidden on a product's single page (reviews, price, variants, etc.)

Check your primary channel settings in BigCommerce (example url: `https://store-<store_hash>.mybigcommerce.com/manage/channel/<channel_id>/store-settings`) and make sure that corresponding items in product display settings are visible.

## Product entity exists. Skipping

If you get the message below, the product must already exist.

```shell
BigCommerce.DEBUG: Product entity exists. Skipping. {"product_id":xxxx,"channel_id":"xxxxx"} []
```

The message in the error logs means that a product has already been imported to WordPress, and it won't be processed again.

## Failed to download image. cURL error 28: Resolving timed out after 10000 milliseconds

If the images fail to download or you come across the following error below, there are steps to resolve this.

```shell
BigCommerce.NOTICE: Failed to download image {"url":"https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-hash/products/18id20/images/id/hps_bottle__13339.1611096484.1280.1280.png?c=2","error":["cURL error 28: Resolving timed out after 10000 milliseconds"]} []
```

This issue occurs during a product/category image import. The issue is environment specific and can be caused by the server itself. Possible reasons for the issue include:

* Network/Firewall settings - outgoing requests can be blocked by it
* DNS failure
* Server limits (e.g., some proxy set on the server and it has its own timeout limit)
* Security modules (Mod_Security) can block requests
* Server is trying to resolve the bigcommerce.com domain using IPv6 instead of IPv4

## E-commerce pages(categories, products single page, checkout) are not visible for the non-logged user

Make sure that your channel that's attached to WordPress isn't in pre-launch status. If it is in pre-launch status, change it to active and perform an import on the WordPress side.

## New/Updated since the last sync doesn't work on Fast import

The `Fast Headless` import doesn't support the "New/Updated since last sync" (partial) option. The fast import option only retrieves categories, brands, and product IDs; all other information loads on the corresponding front page.

## What scopes are necessary for full functionality

The full list of scopes is on the [Multi-site Setup](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/bigcommerce-for-wordpress/setup/multisite#api-account-name-field) page.

## Products are not updated after import

If products are no longer updating after an import, flush the cache on your WordPress setup. In some cases, pages and product information are cached and old information is shown.

## Price is not correct on the single product page (Fast Import)

Often times the price on the product page has the wrong value because of heavy caching. This can happen due to an expired `X-Nonce` for price request. Fix this issue by removing that nonce from the price request. 

The following step should be taken:

* Go to the **Appearance > Customizer > BigCommerce > Product Single > Pricing nonce field(for advanced use only)** and disable nonce.
