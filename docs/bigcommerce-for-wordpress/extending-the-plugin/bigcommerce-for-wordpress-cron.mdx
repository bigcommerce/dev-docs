# BigCommerce for WordPress Cron

This document provides a general description for WP-Cron and how Server Cron can be used to improve WP-Cron's reliability.

BigCommerce for WordPress plugin has update/sync logic which is based on cron jobs (WP-Cron). WP-Cron is built-in logic for processing postponed and background tasks. While that logic is great and flexible, it also has some problems which can affect product import logic.

## WP-Cron versus Server Cron

WordPress has its own cron system for scheduling tasks such as checking for updates, scheduling a post for publication, and deleting comments from the trash. All cron jobs are handled by WP-Cron.

Differences between server cron and WP-Cron include:

- Server cron runs automatically and is fired by server processes. There's no need for an external source for events firing.
- WP-Cron only runs when someone is on the site.

Scheduling a job to run once an hour with WP-cron triggers WordPress to set an execution time for that job. However, the job won't be performed until there's site traffic or there's an external request to WordPress. 

Because of this, WP-Cron jobs can be postponed or not performed at all, whereas a job you schedule with server cron is performed even if there isn't site traffic or external requests.

## Using Server Cron to enhance WP-Cron

To make WP-Cron more reliable and not dependent on site traffic, take the following steps:

### Open and edit wp-config.php

To use server cron jobs, you need to disable WP-Cron events. This suspends currently scheduled WP-Cron jobs as well. Use the following steps to disable WP-Cron jobs:

<Steps>
### Open wp-config file
Open the wp-config file using an FTP client like [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/) or SSH client.

### Add string
Add the following string to the file:

```php
define('DISABLE_WP_CRON', true);
```
</Steps>

### Add new cron job to the server

You can use the following methods to add a new cron job to the server.
