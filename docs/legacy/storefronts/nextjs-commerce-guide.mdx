### Headless BigCommerce

BigCommerce's flexibility allows for headless architecture, the ability to integrate storefront frontends with the BigCommerce backend. Some of the headless setups have the advantage of providing the following:

- Customize your frontend technologies without migrating your database
- Preserve your legacy frontend while switching to BigCommerce as your ecommerce engine
- Power multiple stores on multiple sales channels from a single BigCommerce dashboard.

### Next.js Commerce

Next.js Commerce is a headless integration to BigCommerce. Created in partnership with the Next.js and Vercel teams, Next.js Commerce showcases how powerful Next.js is when partnered with our open SaaS ecommerce platform.

## Getting started

To get started with Next.js Commerce, you can develop locally by cloning the v1 branch of the `vercel/commerce` repo. The following steps will walk you through the process.

### Prerequisites

- An IDE
- Knowledge of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Knowledge of [BigCommerce APIs](/docs/build)
- Git provider (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab)
- NPM

### Developing locally

1. Clone the v1 version: `git clone -b v1 https://github.com/vercel/commerce`
2. Navigate to the locally cloned project's root directory and create a copy of the `.env.template` file. Rename the newly created file `.env.local` and insert your environmental variables using the following as a reference:

```bash filename=".env.template" showLineNumbers copy
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=https://store-${STORE_HASH}.mybigcommerce.com/graphql
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=${STOREFRONT_TOKEN}
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/${STORE_HASH}
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=${STORE_TOKEN}
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=${STORE_CLIENT}
```
&nbsp;
```bash filename=".env.local" showLineNumbers copy
COMMERCE_PROVIDER=bigcommerce
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_URL=https://store-${STORE_HASH}-${CHANNEL_ID}.mybigcommerce.com/graphql
BIGCOMMERCE_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN=${STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN}
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_URL=https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/${STORE_HASH}
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_TOKEN=${STORE_TOKEN}
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_CLIENT_ID=${STORE_CLIENT}
BIGCOMMERCE_CHANNEL_ID=${CHANNEL_ID}
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_URL=https://store-${STORE_HASH}.mybigcommerce.com
BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_API_STORE_HASH=${STORE_HASH}
```

- `STORE_HASH`: You can retrieve it from your BigCommerce store control panel URL in the format of `https://store-${STORE_HASH}.mybigcommerce.com/manage/dashboard`

  ![STORE-HASH location in URL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bigcommerce/dev-docs/master/assets/images/nextjs-commerce-15.png)

- `STORE_TOKEN|STORE_CLIENT`: For instructions on generating store-level API credentials, visit [Creating store-level API credentials](/docs/start/authentication/api-accounts#creating-store-level-api-credentials).
- `STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN`: For instructions on generating the Storefront API token, visit [Create a Token](/docs/rest-authentication/tokens#create-a-token).
- `CHANNEL_ID`: To start, you can use Channel ID 1, for you default storefront. For the API call to cerate a new storefront channel, visit [Create a Channel](/docs/rest-management/channels#create-a-channel). For information on how to retrieve channel information, visit [Get All Channels](/docs/rest-management/channels#get-all-channels).

3. Open a terminal in your repository's root directory. To install the project's dependencies, run `npm install`.

4. When dependencies have finished installing, run `npm run dev` in your terminal. Next.js will load the environmental variables from `.env.local`, start a local server, and compile your project.

5. To see your Next.js Commerce storefront running locally, open `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Application

The architecture for Next.js Commerce is standard for a Next.js application. To learn Next.js basics, visit [the official Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app).

To understand how Commerce generates pages and updates product information on your storefront, we will further explore a couple of concepts.

### Pre-rendering pages

One of the main advantages of Next.js is the fast page load times you can achieve by pre-rendering your content. By default, Next.js pre-renders all pages.

Next.js allows you to choose how pages are pre-rendered:

- **Static Generation:** Next.js generates the HTML at build time and reuses on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering:** Next.js generates the HTML on each request.

Next.js Commerce statically generates pages while still keeping store information updated by using Incremental Static Regeneration.

**Static Page Generation**

Next.js pre-renders static content by calling the `getStaticProps()` function at build time on the server-side. Since `getStaticProps()` does not run on the client-side, you can do direct database queries or run other functions without exposing them to the client. To verify what Next.js eliminates from the client-side bundle, use Vercel's [Code Elimination](https://next-code-elimination.now.sh/) tool.

**Incremental Static Regeneration**

With `getStaticProps()`, you may still use dynamic content on your statically generated pages. Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) updates existing pages by re-rendering them in the background when triggered by site traffic after a set timeout period. By default, data revalidation runs at most once every four hours, though you may customize this frequency.

For more information and a demonstration on how ISR works, visit Vercel's [Static Reactions Demo](https://reactions-demo.vercel.app/).

By default, Next.js Commerce revalidates and updates product information from BigCommerce at most once every four hours.

### Fetching and populating store data

Next.js Commerce uses [Storefront-data-hooks](https://github.com/bigcommerce/storefront-data-hooks) to connect your Next.js frontend with the BigCommerce backend. The package contains code-split React hooks for data fetching using [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) (stale-while-revalidate). SWR is a layer on top of React Hooks that automates cache management. Data can be transitively stale, but SWR will always re-fetch and synchronize the correct data from BigCommerce.

Storefront Data Hooks has helper functions to handle common user actions such as login, logout, and register.

SWR uses FETCH for data fetching: [vercel/fetch: Opinionated fetch (with retrying and DNS caching) optimized for use inside microservices](https://github.com/vercel/fetch).

## Application settings

### SSL/TSL Certificate

To use BigCommerce's [redirected checkout](/docs/storefront/headless/cart-checkout/checkout#redirecting-to-the-bigcommerce-checkout), make sure your Next.js Commerce storefront has an SSL/TSL certificate installed and you are using URL beginning with `https://`.

### Next SEO

Next.js Commerce includes the [Next SEO](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo) plugin to simplify SEO settings so that Next.js Commerce appears correctly in search results and is more readily shareable on social media. To learn how to configure Next SEO settings, visit the [Next SEO GitHub repository](https://github.com/garmeeh/next-seo).

### Component styling

Next.js Commerce uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style components. Next.js Commerce's root directory contains a `tailwind.config.js` file where you can customize much of the project's styling. For more information on how to configure the `tailwind.config.js` file, visit [Tailwind CSS - Configuration](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration).

### Internationalized routing

Next.js supports internationalized (i18n) routing and Next.js Commerce uses [sub-path routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing#sub-path-routing) which puts the locale in the URL path. By default, the `next.config.js` file has US English (`en-US`) and Spanish (`es`) set as locales with `en-US` set as the default.

```json showLineNumbers copy
i18n: {
   locales: ['en-US', 'es'],
   defaultLocale: 'en-US',
}
```

For more information on i18n routing in Next.js, see the Next.js documentation on [internationalized routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/i18n-routing).
