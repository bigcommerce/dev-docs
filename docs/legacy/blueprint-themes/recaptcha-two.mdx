# ReCaptcha 2

 

To deter spam submission through storefront forms, BigCommerce now supports Google [reCAPTCHA v2](https://support.google.com/recaptcha/?hl=en#6080933) challenges, to distinguish human customers/visitors from automated bots.

## Better Spam Deterrence

We recommend that all storefront themes take advantage of this upgraded bot detection. However, BigCommerce's legacy Blueprint themes were last published in our Theme Marketplace before we implemented reCAPTCHA v2. Therefore, please use the following instructions to update your Blueprint-based theme with the best-available deterrent against automated spam.

## How to Upgrade

To incorporate reCAPTCHA v2, you will need to update script references in these three template files: 

* `Panels/CreateAccountForm.html`
* `page_contact_form.html`
* `product_comments.html`

    
<Callout type="warning">
  #### Updating Safely 
  Please back up each file before making any changes. 
</Callout>
 
The instructions below are based on the default Blueprint theme (Classic Next), as it was last published in BigCommerce’s Theme Marketplace. Therefore, the HTML markup will vary, based on customizations you have already made to this theme, or to other Marketplace themes.



### Script Tag to Remove
Search each of the three template files for a ``<script>`` tag like the following. If you find it, delete the whole tag. (This script invokes a legacy reCAPTCHA v1 challenge:)

```html filename="Script Tag to Remove" showLineNumbers copy
<script type="text/javascript"> 
 var RecaptchaOptions = { 
    theme : 'clean' or 'white' 
    }; 
 </script>
```
### Variable to Remove

Alternately, you might see the same `RecaptchaOptions` variable inside a different `<script>` tag at the top of the same three templates. If so, delete the lines shown here:


```js filename="Variable to Remove" showLineNumbers copy
var RecaptchaOptions = { 
 theme : 'clean' or 'white'
};

```

### reCAPTCHA Script to Update

In each of the three template files, add the following script tag to the top of the page.


```html filename="Script Tag to Update" copy
<script src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js" async defer></script>
```

Then replace the "before" code block just below with the simplified "after" code that follows.

#### Replace this (before):
 
```html filename="Script Tag to Remove" showLineNumbers copy
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/challenge?k=%%GLOBAL_ReCaptchaAPIKeyPublic%%">
</script>

<noscript>
    <iframe src="https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api/noscript?k=%%GLOBAL_ReCaptchaAPIKeyPublic%%" height="300" width="500" frameborder="0">
    </iframe>
    <br />
    <textarea name="recaptcha_challenge_field" rows="3" cols="40">
    </textarea>
    <input type="hidden" name="recaptcha_response_field" value="manual_challenge">
</noscript>
```

#### ...with this (after):

```java filename="" copy
%%GLOBAL_ReCaptchaMarkup%%
```
