# Troubleshooting Theme Uploads

 

## Restrictions

Custom theme uploads must meet these restrictions:

* You may upload a maximum of 20 custom themes at a time to the control panel's `Storefront` > `My Themes` section.
* If you reach this maximum, you can delete custom themes to make room for more uploads.
* Before uploading, you must package custom themes into a Stencil-specific zip file format, using Stencil CLI's `stencil bundle` command.
* A theme's zip file must be no larger than 50 MB. If your file exceeds that size, please use either a WebDAV or a CDN upload to exclude large static assets.
* Generated parsed template files must be less than 1 MB.

## Error codes

| Error code | Meaning |
|:- | - |
| TR-100, -101, -700, -1200, -1300 | A server error occurred. |
| TR-200 | Problem uploading the theme. |
| TR-300 | Invalid zip file. (Among other possible root causes, this can indicate an included `bundle.js.map` source-map file that exceeds its size limit of 5 MB. As a workaround, move this file outside your theme directory before re-running `stencil bundle`.) |
| TR-301 | Failed to unzip file. |
| TR-400 | The zip contains restricted/invalid file(s) - e.g., a file with an invalid extension. |
| TR-500 | The zip file is larger than the 50 MB limit, or the parsed JSON for templates exceeds the 1 MB size limit. |
| TR-600 | The zip file is missing a required file (`theme-name/templates/pages/home.html`). |
| TR-601 | The zip file is missing some parsed template file(s); or, one or more non-`.html` files are present in the `theme-name/templates/</nobr>` subdirectory. |
| TR-800 | There was a problem processing the contained `config.json` file. Please check the `config.json` documentation for the required keys and for keys that require values. |
| TR-900 | The contained `config.json` file is missing the required developer information. |
| TR-901 | A theme variation defined in the contained config.json file is missing its required external ID. |
| TR-902 | Two or more theme variations defined in the contained config.json file share an external ID. All external IDs must be unique. | 
| TR-1000 | There was a problem processing the contained <a href="https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/schema.json">schema.json</a> file. |
| TR-1001 | The theme is missing its required <a href="https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/schema.json">schema.json</a> file. |
| TR-1400 | There was a problem processing template <a href="/docs/storefront/stencil/themes/context/frontmatter">front matter</a>. |

| TR-4400 | One or more values in the `config.json` file exceed the 64-character limit. (The 64-character limit only applies to values in `config.json` that are both greater than 64 characters and mapped to a text input in the theme's `schema.json` file.) |

## Warnings

Warnings will not block a theme's upload, but these onscreen and/or log messages notify you of problems within the zipped theme. Here are the warnings and their meanings:

| Warning |
|-|
| (These messages do not have numeric codes) |
| Issue in processing this theme's thumbnail screenshot (`composed_image`). |
| Issue in processing this theme's full-size screenshot (`desktop_screenshot`). |
| Issue in processing this theme's mobile [screenshot](/docs/storefront/stencil/themes/context/object-reference/config#configjson) (`mobile_screenshot`). |
| Missing file: This theme does not support the Theme Editor, as it is missing its required `[schema.json]` file. |
| One or more of this theme's screenshots are not image files. |
| Theme is missing a valid thumbnail image (`composed_image`). |
| Theme is missing a valid full-size image (`desktop_screenshot`). |
| Theme is missing a valid mobile image (`mobile_screenshot`). |
| One or more of this theme's images is not of a supported file type. Valid filetypes are: JPEG, PNG, GIF. |
| Thumbnail (`composed_image`) image dimensions are not right. The expected dimensions are 600 x 760 pixels. |
| Full-size (`desktop_screenshot`) image dimensions are not right. The expected dimensions are 2048 x 2600 pixels. |
| Mobile (`mobile_screenshot`) image dimensions are not right. The expected dimensions are 304 x 540 pixels. |
| Too-large image file size for a theme screenshot `composed_image` (thumbnails), `desktop_screenshot`, or `mobile_screenshot`] . The maximum supported size is x, but the file's actual size is y. |

## Workarounds and further info
* When using a Windows machine, it is necessary to close PowerShell and re-open as admin before installing nvm.

* If a custom theme does not render properly after you upload and apply it to a storefront, make sure you have created the theme's zip file using the `stencil bundle` command, on a Mac OS, Linux computer, or virtual machine. Using the `stencil bundle` command will exclude Windows-specific errors that have occurred on some bundles.

* If you repeatedly encounter the same error or warning and neither this page nor our KB resolves the problem, see support resources for theme developers in our [Developer Community](/community).
