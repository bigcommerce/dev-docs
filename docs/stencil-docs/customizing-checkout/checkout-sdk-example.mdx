# Checkout SDK Tutorial

This tutorial assumes you are familiar with the Checkout SDK. If you are unfamiliar with the Checkout SDK, refer to [Getting Started with Checkout SDK](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/checkout-sdk/tutorial) to get some general information. 

In this tutorial, we will create a custom checkout using a checkout loader file, building on the steps from the [Getting Started with Checkout SDK](/docs/storefront/cart-checkout/checkout-sdk/tutorial) article. This tutorial will outline how to package a custom checkout file and install a custom checkout using the control panel.


## Creating a checkout-loader.js file

In your text editor, create a file for upload called `checkout-loader-<version>.js` with the following content, where `<version>` represents an arbitrary version number used for invalidating cached versions of the file.

```js copy
var script = document.createElement('script');
script.onload = function () {
    checkoutKitLoader.load('checkout-sdk')
        .then(function (module) {
            var checkoutService = module.createCheckoutService();
            return checkoutService.loadCheckout(window.checkoutConfig.checkoutId);
        })
        .then(function (state) {
            console.log('Checkout SDK Quickstart', state.data.getCheckout());
            document.getElementById(window.checkoutConfig.containerId).innerHTML = 'Checkout ID: ' + state.data.getCheckout().id;
        });
};
script.src = 'https://checkout-sdk.bigcommerce.com/v1/loader.js';
document.head.appendChild(script);
```

Comparing the content of this newly created file and the code from the [Getting Started with Checkout SDK](/docs/stencil-docs/customizing-checkout/checkout-sdk-quickstart#installing-the-checkout-js-sdk), you should see a clear resemblance between the two.

## Use WebDAV to upload the checkout-loader.js file

You can upload the checkout-loader.js file to your store's server using WebDAV by following the instructions below:

1. Before proceeding, ensure you have downloaded [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), our recommended WebDAV client. For more information on how to use Cyberduck, refer to [File Access (WebDAV)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV).
2. From your store control panel, navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **File access (WebDAV)**.
  * To automatically connect with Cyberduck, see [Single-click Login](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#login).
  * To manually connect with Cyberduck, see [Connecting with Cyberduck Manually](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV#manual).
3. From Cyberduck, enter the `/content` folder, create a new folder, and name it _checkout_.
4. Copy the file `checkout-loader.js` into the newly created _checkout_ folder on WebDAV.

## Install your custom checkout using the control panel

To install a custom checkout on a store, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Advanced** > **Checkout** in your store's control panel.
2. Under **Checkout Type**, select **Custom Checkouts**.
3. Type the following in the Script URL field:

```js copy
webdav:checkout/checkout-loader-<version>.js
```


NOTES:

* Prepending `webdav`: indicates that the URL is in the remote WebDAV directory. It treats `/content` as the root WebDAV directory.

* It is best practice to include a `<version>` number in the Script URL field. Note that if you change the same provided loader filename, you could serve a cached version to the user.

4. Click the **Save** button at the bottom of the page.
5. Navigate to your live storefront to view your new custom checkout.

## Log the checkout object

1. Open your browser console and ensure you are logged in to collect cart and checkout information.
2. Add an item to your cart and proceed to the checkout page. The checkout page will be blank below the header.
3. From your developerâ€™s console, execute the following command to fetch checkout content:

```js copy
state.data.getCheckout();
```

In the developer console, you will see the checkout object, and you can test out additional `state.data` commands. 

This tutorial also gives you the steps to build a custom checkout. Instead of working with code in our theme, as shown in the [Getting Started with Checkout SDK](/docs/stencil-docs/customizing-checkout/checkout-sdk-quickstart) article, we created a file and uploaded it to WebDAV, effectively taking over the entire checkout experience.
