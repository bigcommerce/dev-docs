## Checkout options

| | What is it? | When should I use it? | Where do I find it? |
|-|-|-|-|
|**Open Checkout**| Open checkout is the open-source option of BigCommerce's Optimized One-page Checkout.<br/><br/> A browswer-based application that converts a cart to an order, allowing shoppers to complete checkout.<br/><br/> It is our reference implementation of checkout built on top of the Checkout JS SDK. | Developers that want to create a custom checkout from a fully functional foundation (as a starting point for their own efforts or even contribute to it.<br/> <br/>Add features or make moderate-sized changes to BigCommerceâ€™s checkout (hosted on the BigCommerce storefront.) | GitHub: [Checkout JS](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-js)<br/><br/> Dev Center: [Open Checkout Quick Start](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/customizing-checkout/open-checkout-quick-start)
|**Checkout JS SDK**| A client-side vanilla JavaScript library that is a wrapper for the Storefront Checkout API.<br/><br/> The SDK handles all the API calls necessary to move shoppers through the checkout experience. From customer login, fetching shipping quotes, and fetching payment methods through to paying an order.| Developers that want to build a custom checkout from scratch by creating their own presentation layer for checkout. Completely replace the UI/UX without having to do the heavy lifting of dealing with Storefront API endpoints.<br/><br/> Significant front-end customizations and/or feature additions to checkout (hosted on the BigCommerce storefront).<br/><br/> Note: SDK does not let you introduce new behavior. Whilst you can perform actions such as filter shipping methods based, you cannot for example create new shipping methods (or payment methods). The SDK is a convenient wrapper to the BigCommerce owned and defined business logic of checkout.| GitHub: [Checkout JS SDK](https://github.com/bigcommerce/checkout-js)<br/><br/> Dev Center: [Checkout SDK](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/customizing-checkout/checkout-sdk#storefront-cart-and-checkout)|
| **Storefront Checkout API** | REST APIs to create and update checkout and convert it to an order. <br/><br/> Note: GraphQL available in the future. | Developers that want to build a custom checkout experience (within the context of a BigCommerce storefront session) by accessing raw API request/response data.<br/><br/> These are the APIs you would typically access from your browser using JavaScript to retrieve checkout data not available through the SDK. | Dev Center: [Storefront Checkout API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/storefront/checkouts)|
| **Server-to-server Checkout API** | REST APIs to create and update checkout and convert them to an order. | Developers that want to build a custom checkout (outside of a BigCommerce storefront session) and use the [Payments API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/payment-processing) to pay for an order.<br/><br/> When used with the [Server to Server Cart API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/carts) it allows you to make modifications similar to those performed using the control panel option **Orders > Add**. These modifications include the ability to create custom products, modify prices, add custom discounts, set custom prices for shipping, etc.<br/><br/> These are the APIs that will power your headless checkout solutions on channels such as: <br/>* Content management systems<br/> * Native mobile apps (non-web view)<br/> * Internet of Things (IoT) devices<br/> * Recurring order and/or subscription apps (e.g. OrderGroove)<br/><br/> Note: Currently, this API currently does not support using store credit or gift certificates as payment methods. | Dev Center: [Server to Server Checkout API](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/api-reference/store-management/checkouts) |
