## Working with the optimized checkout SCSS file

Cornerstone includes a SCSS file that styles the Optimized Checkout page. In your local installation, this file is located at <span class="fn">`cornerstone/assets/scss/optimized-checkout.scss`</span>.

You can access the most recent version of this file in the [Cornerstone repository](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/assets/scss/optimized-checkout.scss). All themes share the same stylesheet for the Optimized One-Page checkout, even those not based on Cornerstone, so this stylesheet applies universally across Stencil themes.

### Customizing checkout restrictions
> When customizing the checkout page, you are free to change classes' contents; however, **do not** nest elements or change any class names. BigCommerce imposes these restrictions because each class here maps to multiple optimized checkout elements. Changing the structure or naming would break updates available in future optimized checkout enhancements.

## Configuring the desktop viewport

To set up optimized checkout's responsive features within the `optimized-checkout.scss` file, you should configure the following breakpoint to define your preferred desktop viewport size:


```css
    // TODO:
    // Configure media query to be 'desktop' breakpoint size
    // --
    @media (min-width: 801px) {
        text-align: stencilString("optimizedCheckout-logo-position");
    }
```

## Classes available for customization

Below are the classes provided in Cornerstone's `optimized-checkout.scss`, with the corresponding page elements that they style.  These class names and mappings are subject to change, so please check the inline comments in the `optimized-checkout.scss` file that you downloaded with your current Cornerstone release.


| **Class** | **Styles this Optimized One-Page Checkout element:** |
|-|-|
| `.optimizedCheckout-header` | Page header. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-headingPrimary` | Top-level headings. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-headingSecondary` | Certain lower-level elements, such as descriptions of cart items. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-overlay` | Shipping Method box. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-contentPrimary` | Body text in the desktop `Order Summary`/`Order Confirmation` (cart contents); drop-down-list items; and text that summarizes completed steps. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-contentSecondary` | Text labels on check boxes, and lower-level text in the desktop Order Summary. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-button--primary` | `CONTINUE` button and final `PAY` button. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-button--secondary` | `Edit` buttons.
| `.optimizedCheckout-orderSummary` | Colors in the `Order Summary` mobile drawer/modal.
| `.optimizedCheckout-step` | Large step-number indicators on the page's left side. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-form-label` | Styles form fields like `Email Address` – the field's text-label color. |
| `.optimizedCheckout-form-input` | Styles form fields like `Email Address` – the entry box's background and border colors. |

## Providing customizable options in Page Builder


You can determine which aspects of Optimized One-Page Checkout merchants will customize with the Page Builder tool.


In Cornerstone's `optimized-checkout.scss`, each SCSS class and property available has a corresponding key/value pair in the `config.json` file, which can be used as the `id` value in schema.json when [creating customizable Page Builder options](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/schema.json).

## Currency conversion options

You can enable the display of alternate currencies on your Stencil theme's Optimized One-Page Checkout and order confirmation pages.

<div class="HubBlock--callout">
<div class="CalloutBlock--warning">
<div class="HubBlock-content">

<!-- theme: warning -->

### Restrictions
> The options on this page require that you first enable Optimized One-Page Checkout. Find instructions on how to do this in [Optimized One-Page Checkout](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Optimized-Single-Page-Checkout).

Note that regardless of the display options you set below, you will always process transactions in the store's single default currency. To change that setting, see [Changing Your Default Currency](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Managing-Currencies#default).

To allow shoppers to view prices in multiple currencies, you will need to add the desired currencies via the BigCommerce control panel.

Shoppers will then be able to use the Currency drop-down list throughout the storefront to switch displayed prices among the enabled currencies.

At checkout, the shopper still receives the bill in the store's default currency. As shown below, the checkout and cart templates will show an annotation about this while flagging any converted total (in a shopper's selected alternate currency) as an Estimated Total:

<!--
