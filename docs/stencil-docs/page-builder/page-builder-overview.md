# Page Builder

Page Builder allows you to customize the different style elements of your theme, like colors, text sizes, the number of featured products to show on the homepage, and more. You can use this to tailor your storefront so it more closely reflects your brand.
In addition, you can use the built-in page builder to drag and drop content like text blocks, images, videos, banners, carousels, buttons, and blocks of custom HTML. This enables you to showcase your products in a way that is visually rich.
Page Builder provides access to your theme’s template files to allow for advanced template editing. You can access previous versions of your theme’s design changes, and restore the original theme’s styles if you want to reset the theme back to its default settings.
