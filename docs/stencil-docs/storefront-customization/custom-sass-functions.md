## Custom Sass Functions

| Custom Sass Function  | Description  |
|---|---|
| stencilColor  | `stencilColor` accepts (as a string) the key name of a color that you have defined in <span class="fn">config.json</span> as editable. It returns the color’s hexadecimal value.s|
| stencilFontFamily  | `stencilFontFamily` accepts (as a string) the name of a font key that you have defined in config.json. It returns the corresponding font-family value, also as a string. For a key named "headings-font" and defined as Google Open Sans, `stencilFontFamily` would return a value like this to Sass variables: `$headings-‐font-‐family: 'Open Sans';` (The example's name and definition in config.json are both arbitrary.) Your Sass stylesheet must call stencilFontFamily for each <span class="fn">config.json</span> font key whose font-family value you want to provide to Sass variables. You would call the function in the following format (again assuming a key arbitrarily named "headings-font"): `$headings-font-family: stencilFontFamily("headings-font");`  |
| stencilFontWeight  | `stencilFontWeight` accepts (as a string) the key name of a font that you have defined in config.json. It returns (as an integer) the corresponding font-weight value. For a key arbitrarily named "headings-font" and defined as 700, it would return a value like this to Sass variables: `$headings-‐font-‐weight: 700;` Your Sass stylesheet may optionally call stencilFontWeight for each <span class="fn">config.json</span> font key whose weight value you want to provide to Sass variables. You would call the function in the following format: `$headings-font-weight: stencilFontWeight("headings-font");`  |
| stencilNumber  | `stencilNumber` accepts (as a string) a key name that you have defined in config.json as editable. It also accepts (also as a string) an optional second parameter to define the unit. (This second parameter’s value defaults to `px`.) It returns the corresponding numeric value, postfixed with the defined unit. You can use this function with arithmetical operators. For example, assume that your config.json contains a `font-size` value of `3`. The following statement would evaluate to `9rem`. `stencilNumber("font-size", "rem") * 3`  |
| stencilString  | `stencilString` accepts (as a string) a key name that you have defined in <span class="fn">config.json</span> as editable. It returns (also as a string) the key’s value. This function is used for purposes like defining font family names, or defining paths to images.  |
| stencilImage  | `stencilImage` accepts (as a string) a key name for an image url that you have defined in <span class="fn">config.json</span>. It also accepts (as a string) the key name for the image size that you have defined in <span class="fn">config.json</span>. It returns the string value of the image URL and the size.  |

## Compiling Custom Sass Files

If you want to add your own custom Sass files to a theme, initiate auto-compilation of those files by including the associated tag in your HTML markup. Cornerstone's Sass file is named:

<span class="fp">/cornerstone/assets/scss/theme.scss</span>

To add a custom Sass file, place it at this path location, using an arbitrary filename prefix as shown:

<span class="fp">/assets/scss/theme-or-file-name.scss</span>

For example, to use the Foundation Sass framework, you might need:

<span class="fp">{theme-name}/assets/scss/main.scss</span>
`<theme-name>/assets/scss/widgets.scss`

Next, be sure the following tag is included within your `<theme-name>/templates/layout/base.html` file’s `<head>` tag, to compile your Sass to the specified object file:

`{{stylesheet '/assets/css/theme.css'}}`

While `stencil start` is running, it will recompile your custom Sass files to the specified <span class="fp">{theme-name}/assets/css/theme.css</span> file. (Note that this object file’s name is always the same, and is independent of your custom Sass files’ names.) For an additional example, please see Replacing Content Blocks.
