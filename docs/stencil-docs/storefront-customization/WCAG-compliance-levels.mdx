# WCAG Compliance Levels


This article demonstrates how Cornerstone satisfies [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#guidelines) across compliance levels. You can apply similar techniques to your site regardless of your compliance level. For detailed implementation information, see [Implementing WCAG Guidelines](/docs/storefront/stencil/themes/accessibility/implementing-wcag-guidelines).

## Accessibility principles
WCAG organizes accessibility guidelines into four principles.

**Perceivable.** Users can comprehend the information being presented. 
The information cannot be invisible to all their senses.

**Operable.** Users can perform actions using interface components and navigate the site.
The interface cannot require interaction that a user cannot perform.

**Understandable.** The information and operation of a user interface are understandable.
The operation of interface or information cannot cause confusion or discomfort for users.

**Robust.** Users can perform a wide variety of technologies.
The content cannot cause content inaccessibility.

We encourage you to create content that addresses all four principles. If any principle is missing, users with disabilities will not be able to successfully use and access web content. 

## Accessibility guidelines
Each principle contains guidelines, the goals you should work towards to achieve a certain conformance level. 

The guidelines featured below are not a complete list and were chosen to highlight possible solutions for how to meet requirements. This article demonstrates how Cornerstone meets the success criteria for the following guidelines.
