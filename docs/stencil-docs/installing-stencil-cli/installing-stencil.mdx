# Installing Stencil CLI

<Callout type="warning">
BigCommerce is currently targeting 11/1/2023 to sunset its node-sass fork in favor of the latest [sass/node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass). To ensure that your storefront is up to date, use the latest node version (Node 18) in Stencil CLI and use the CLI command to resolve [incompatible SCSS directives](/stencil-docs/installing-stencil-cli/troubleshooting-your-setup#incompatible-scss-directives), which can cause issues with the styling of your storefront.

Stencil CLI allows developers to locally edit and preview themes without impacting a merchant's live storefront, and its built-in [Browsersync](https://github.com/bigcommerce/browser-sync) capabilities make simultaneous testing across desktop, mobile, and tablet devices a breeze. Once work is complete, developers can push themes to BigCommerce storefronts and make them live using Stencil CLI's simple yet powerful commands.


This article contains detailed instructions on installing and configuring Stencil CLI, the first step towards developing Stencil themes for BigCommerce storefronts.



## Installing on Mac

To install Stencil CLI and its dependencies on Mac, open a terminal and run the following commands. Refer to [Stencil CLI README.MD](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-cli) for latest `node` version supported.

```shell showLineNumbers copy
# For ARM based macs
arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh

# Install Node Version Manager (nvm)
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash

# Install Stencil CLI supported version of Node.js
nvm install 18.15.0

# Switch to Stencil CLI supported version of Node.js:
nvm use 18.15.0

# Install Stencil CLI
npm install -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli
```

## Installing on Windows
There are two methods for installing Stencil CLI and its dependencies on Windows.


### Method 1: Install dependencies using Chocolatey
If you prefer a streamlined installation option, use the [Chocolatey package manager](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install Stencil CLI's dependencies. To do so, [open PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/starting-windows-powershell?view=powershell-6) as an administrator, and run the following commands:


```shell showLineNumbers copy
# Install Chocolatey
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1"))

# Install git if you don't have it
choco install git

# Install nvm windows and stencil-compatible node.js

choco install nvm; nvm install 18.15.0; nvm use 18.15.0

# Install Stencil CLI
npm install -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli
```

<Callout type="warning">
 #### Execution policy errors
 If you receive an execution policy error while attempting to install chocolatey, refer to [Microsoft's Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-6) and/or consult with your organization's system administrator to determine the appropriate course of action.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
 #### Chocolatey installation alternatives
 For additional information on installing Chocolatey and alternative installation options, see [the installation page on chocolatey.org](https://chocolatey.org/install).
 </Callout>

### Method 2: Install dependencies manually

If you're a pro at installing and configuring Python and Node.js environments on Windows, feel free to install the required dependencies using your preferred method.

**Required Dependencies:**
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - required to run npm install
* [Node.js 18.15.0 and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) 

Once they're installed and configured, use `npm` to install Stencil CLI:

```shell  copy
npm install -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli
```

 These instructions have been tested successfully on **Windows 10**.
 Refer to [Stencil CLI README.MD](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-cli) for latest `node` version supported.
 </Callout>

## Installing on Linux

To install Stencil CLI and dependencies on debian-based distros, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```shell showLineNumbers copy
# Download and install nvm if you don't have it.
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.36.0/install.sh | bash

# Reload .bashrc so nvm command works
source ~/.bashrc

# Explicitly install and use supported node version
nvm install 18.15.0

nvm use 18.15.0

# Install stencil
npm install -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli
```

**Depending on the distro, you may also need to install:**
* g++
* [libsass](https://sass-lang.com/libsass)
* git

<Callout type="info">
 * These instructions have been tested on **Ubuntu 18.04**.
 * Refer to [Stencil CLI README.MD](https://github.com/bigcommerce/stencil-cli) for latest `node` version supported.
 * Refer to [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for latest `nvm` install instructions.
</Callout>

## Live previewing a theme

Once you've installed Stencil CLI, the next step on the road to theme development is downloading a theme to edit and previewing live changes using Stencil CLI's powerful Browsersync functionality. For detailed instructions on doing so, see [Live Previewing a Theme](/docs/storefront/stencil/cli/development-server). Here's the gist:


```shell showLineNumbers copy
# move into theme dir
cd ~/path/to/theme/dir

# install theme modules
npm install

# initialize a new .stencil config for the theme
stencil init

# serve a live, Browsersync enabled preview of the theme
stencil start
```
## Troubleshooting

### Chocolatey install error
If you receive an error installing Chocolatey, run the following command to enable scripts on your system.

```powershell copy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

### Visual Studio not found error

Stencil CLI's dependencies no longer require Visual C++ build tools to compile. 

If you receive the error "Could not find VS", update to the most current version of Stencil CLI and run it using the version of Node.js indicated in this article.


### Python npm configuration error

Stencil CLI's dependencies no longer require Python to compile. 

If you receive "Error: Could not find any Python installation to use", update to the most current version of Stencil CLI and run it using the version of Node.js indicated in this article.
