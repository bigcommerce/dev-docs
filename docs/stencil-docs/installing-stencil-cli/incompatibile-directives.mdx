# Incompatible Directives

Since we have different versions of node-sass running in Stencil CLI and production, there can be differences in the output of the CSS.
This doc covers the differences and how to avoid them until the node-sass fork is sunset.

## Examples

1. To avoid using / divisions in scss directives
Since the support of SCSS directives came after the node-sass fork, the SCSS directives will break on production with an error stating that this syntax is not supported.
So we do not recommend using it in your SCSS files until the node-sass fork is sunset.

For more information, see [Issue 2149](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2149).

2. Usage of color with $hue parameter.

Example 

```shell showLineNumbers copy
$color: #1caf9a;

body {
  background: change-color($color, $hue: 120);
}
```

This will lead to different behavior in Stencil CLI and production. 
So we do not recommend using it in your SCSS files until the node-sass fork is sunset.


For more information, see [Issue 2112](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2112).


3. Concatenating an empty string w/ a quoted string will unquote the string.

Example 

```shell showLineNumbers copy
@debug "\"foo\"" + "";
```

Will lead to different behaviour in stencil cli (quoted) and production (unquoted).

4. if() function does not correctly evaluate the parent selector

Example

```shell showLineNumbers
@function foo() {
  @return if(& != null, green, red);
}

test {
  color: foo();
}
```

This will lead to 
```shell showLineNumbers copy
test {
  color: green;
}
```

in Stencil CLI and

```shell showLineNumbers copy
test {
  color: red;
}
```
in production.
