# Incompatible Directives

As of this writing, BigCommerce is using a fork of node-sass that we plan to sunset in the future. Because Stencil CLI and BigCommerce's servers are running different versions of node-sass, there can be differences in the compiled CSS output.

This article covers the known divergent behavior and describes how to avoid unexpected compiler errors until the node-sass fork sunsets.

## Examples

1. In production, using the `/` character in SCSS directives causes a compiler error.

Because support for SCSS directives came after the node-sass fork, SCSS directives that contain the `/` literal will break in production with an error stating that this syntax is not supported.

We do not recommend using `/` in your SCSS files until the node-sass fork is sunset.

For more information, see [Issue 2149 (GitHub / libsass)](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2149).

2. The `$hue` parameter behaves differently. 

The following example demonstrates the context in which you might pass `$hue` or encounter it in library packages:

```scss filename="Example: $hue parameter" showLineNumbers copy
$color: #1caf9a;

body {
  background: change-color($color, $hue: 120);
}
```

Using `$hue` leads to different behavior in Stencil CLI versus in production. 

We do not recommend including `$hue` in your SCSS functions until the node-sass fork is sunset.

3. In production, concatenating an empty string with a quoted string unquotes the string.

The following example demonstrates the context in which you might concatenate an empty string or encounter it in library packages:

```scss filename="Example: Empty string concatenation" showLineNumbers copy
@debug "\"foo\"" + "";
```

Empty string arguments lead to divergent behavior between Stencil CLI, which supports empty string concatenation, and production, which unquotes strings. 

Pay particular attention to SCSS functions that might receive empty strings as arguments.

4. The `if()` method does not correctly evaluate its parent selector.

For example, consider the following function:

```scss filename="Example: Function that uses if()" showLineNumbers copy
@function foo() {
  @return if(& != null, green, red);
}

test {
  color: foo();
}
```
In the preceding example, the fork's error in the evaluation of the `if()` method leads to the following divergent results:

```css filename="Stencil CLI output" showLineNumbers copy
test {
  color: green;
}
```

```css filename="Production output" showLineNumbers copy
test {
  color: red;
}
```
