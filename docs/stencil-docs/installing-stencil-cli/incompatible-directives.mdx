# Incompatible Directives

**At your convenience, you must update your SCSS file structure and syntax to compile correctly and avoid frontend styling issues.** This upgrade is necessary to ensure the security of our platform going forward and to ensure we’re not running any out-of-date software that may be at additional risk for security vulnerabilities. Your current production site will continue to function as designed, but all future updates will require you to address any SCSS compatibility issues with Node.js 18. 

This article covers the known divergent behavior and describes how to avoid unexpected compiler errors due to the Stencil CLI and BigCommerce's servers running different versions of node-sass.

To ensure that your storefront is up to date, review the [Deprecation and Sunset Support for Node-Sass](/docs/storefront/stencil/cli/node-sass) information to learn about the two possible options for updating your node-sass compiler.

## Examples

1. In production, using the `/` character in SCSS directives causes a compiler error.

Because support for SCSS directives came after the node-sass fork, SCSS directives that contain the `/` literal will break in production with an error stating that this syntax is not supported.

We do not recommend using `/` in your SCSS files until the node-sass fork is sunset.

For more information, see [Issue 2149 (GitHub / libsass)](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2149).

2. The `$hue` parameter behaves differently. 

The following example demonstrates the context in which you might pass `$hue` or encounter it in library packages:

```scss filename="Example: $hue parameter" showLineNumbers copy
$color: #1caf9a;

body {
  background: change-color($color, $hue: 120);
}
```

Using `$hue` leads to different behavior in Stencil CLI versus in production. 

We do not recommend including `$hue` in your SCSS functions until the node-sass fork is sunset.

For more information, see [Issue 2112 (GitHub / libsass)](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2112).


3. In production, concatenating an empty string with a quoted string unquotes the string.

The following example demonstrates the context in which you might concatenate an empty string or encounter it in library packages:

```scss filename="Example: Empty string concatenation" showLineNumbers copy
@debug "\"foo\"" + "";
```

Empty string arguments lead to divergent behavior between Stencil CLI, which supports empty string concatenation, and production, which unquotes strings. 

Pay particular attention to SCSS functions that might receive empty strings as arguments.

For more information, see [Issue 2153 (GitHub / libsass)](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/2153).

4. The `if()` method does not correctly evaluate its parent selector.

For example, consider the following function:

```scss filename="Example: Function that uses if()" showLineNumbers copy
@function foo() {
  @return if(& != null, green, red);
}

test {
  color: foo();
}
```
In the preceding example, the fork's error in the evaluation of the `if()` method leads to the following divergent results:

```css filename="Stencil CLI output" showLineNumbers copy
test {
  color: green;
}
```

```css filename="Production output" showLineNumbers copy
test {
  color: red;
}
```
