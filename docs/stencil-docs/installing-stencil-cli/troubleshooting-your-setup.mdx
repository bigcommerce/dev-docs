# Troubleshooting Your Setup


When you encounter unexpected behavior while developing your Stencil theme, start troubleshooting by checking the terminal window where you started Stencil CLI.

In some cases, the terminal provides verbose error messages specifying where to look for problems. These have the potential to provide insight into the root cause of errors. For error messages that may not be helpful in revealing the issue you're experiencing, diagnostic suggestions are listed in this article.

<Callout type="warning">
  BigCommerce is sunsetting its node-sass fork in favor of the latest [sass/node-sass (GitHub)](https://github.com/sass/node-sass). To ensure that your storefront is up to date, use the [latest Node.js version with long-term support](https://nodejs.org/en) or the maintenance node version to run the Stencil CLI and use the CLI command to resolve [incompatible SCSS directives](#incompatible-scss-directives), which can cause errors and consistency issues with your storefront's CSS. Your current production site will continue to function as designed, but all future updates will require you to address any SCSS compatibility issues with Node.js 18. This upgrade is necessary to ensure the security of our platform and that you are not running out-of-date packages that may expose your projects to additional security vulnerabilities.

</Callout>

## Incompatible SCSS directives

To ensure that your storefront is up to date, perform the following steps:

1. Using the latest version of Stencil CLI, run the `stencil bundle` command to validate your theme's code. Note any errors in the console output.

```shell copy
stencil bundle
```

2. To ensure the correct formatting, update your theme files by running the following script. This step allows you to see changes before merging.

```shell copy
stencil scss-autofix --dry
```

3. To commit the changes and revalidate, run the following commands:

```shell showLineNumbers copy
stencil scss-autofix 
stencil bundle
```

4. After making changes, you can test your site by running the following command:

```shell copy
stencil start
```

5. If everything looks good, use the following command to push and deploy your changes to the storefront.

```shell copy
stencil push
```

For more information, see [Incompatible Directives](/docs/storefront/stencil/cli/incompatible-directives).

## Unsupported Node version

If you receive the following error message, please reinstall Node.js to the [latest Node.js version with long-term support](https://nodejs.org/en):

```text filename="Error, no parse method" showLineNumbers copy
Debug: internal, implementation, error
        TypeError: Uncaught error: Object #<Object> has no method 'parse'
        at internals.implementation
        (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/stencil-cli/server/plugins/CssCompiler/index.js:32:26)
```

On MacOS, we have tested Stencil CLI most robustly on Node.js version 4.4.0. On Linux, we have tested most robustly on version 4.1.2. On Windows, we have tested most robustly on version 4.6.1. You’ll find detailed steps (for each operating system) in these instructions' Installing Stencil Prerequisites by OS section.

## npm install errors

The following headings represent errors that may occur when running the `npm install` command. The content under each heading issues a fix for the issue.

### Unmet peer dependency error

If you get any `Unmet Peer Dependency` errors when issuing the `npm install` command make sure you are running the `npm install` command **inside** your theme directory.

If running the `npm install ` command inside your theme directory does not resolve the error, try one of the following:

* Try removing your theme directory's `/node_modules/` subdirectory, by running `rm -rf node_modules`

* Run the `npm cache clean` command

* Re-run `npm install`

### Permissions errors

If you get a file-permissions error such as `EPERM` or `EACCES` when issuing the `npm install` command, try one of the workarounds listed on [Fixing npm Permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) (docs.npmjs.com).

### js/bundle errors

If you get errors of the following type upon executing the `stencil init` command:

```text showLineNumbers copy
Potentially unhandled rejection [6] TypeError: Error loading "js/bundle"
at file:/Users/<username>/Desktop/Fortune-1.4.6/assets/js/bundle.js
Error evaluating file:/Users/<username>/Desktop/Fortune-1.4.6/assets/js/bundle.js
Cannot read property 'createElement' of undefined...
```

Try the following workaround:

1. Download and unzip a fresh copy of the theme.

2. Refresh theme dependencies by running `npm install`.

3. Run `stencil init`.

*You will see the same error message as before, but proceed to:*

4. Delete the `assets/js/bundle.js` file.

5. Run `stencil init` again.
This should now execute properly.

6. Run `stencil start`.

7. Verify your theme's launch at: http://localhost:3000.

### Stencil CLI as a non-global dependency

If Stencil CLI is included as a dependency in a project's `package.json` file, you may get a long error message like the following when executing the `npm install` command:

```text filename="Non-global invalid syntax error" showLineNumbers copy
npm ERR! gyp ERR! stack Error: Command failed: /usr/local/bin/python -c import sys; print "%s.%s.%s" % sys.version_info[:3];
npm ERR! gyp ERR! stack   File "<string>", line 1
npm ERR! gyp ERR! stack     import sys; print "%s.%s.%s" % sys.version_info[:3];
npm ERR! gyp ERR! stack                                ^
npm ERR! gyp ERR! stack SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```

This error typically occurs when your `package.json` file includes an outdated version of Stencil CLI. In general, it's best to install Stencil CLI globally. It is not designed to function as a project dependency or devDependency.

### Running stencil bundle errors

Nowadays, `stencil bundle` runs several validation checks on a theme before it can be bundled and pushed to the store. 

You may see those errors because your theme has some missing properties in its translations files or frontmatter that have recently become required.

For example, if your theme is missing a translation key in the `i18n.HeaderAndFooter` property of its `schemaTranslations.json` file, running `stencil bundle` may result in the following error:

```text showLineNumbers copy
Error: Your theme's schemaTranslations.json has errors:
missing translation key "i18n.HeaderAndFooter"
```

The following error occurs when some translation keys in the `schemaTranslations.json` file are missed and aren't available to the theme.

```text showLineNumbers copy
Error: Missed schemaTranslations.json file
```

```text showLineNumbers copy
Error: Your theme's schemaTranslations.json has errors:
unused translation key "i18n.ProductSaleBadges"
unused translation key "i18n.ShowProductSaleBadges"
```

The following error indicates that there is a trailing comma in the frontmatter of the `home.html` file.

```test showLineNumbers copy
Error: Found unallowed trailing symbol in: "4,", while parsing frontmatter at ".....templates/pages/home.html".
```

### Node support 

When you update the Node.js version, you can check to see whether you can update other theme packages, such as webpack, for updated feature support.

## npm install and stencil init errors

If you get an unexpected error messages when issuing the `npm install` or `stencil init` commands, check your Node.js version and ensure it aligns with a version compatible for the Stencil framework.

## stencil init/stencil start errors

If you get an unexpected error message or unexpected results upon executing the `stencil init`, `stencil start`, or other Stencil CLI commands, make sure you are working in the subdirectory for the specific theme you intend to launch.

One way of checking what directory you are working in is by running the `pwd` command in your terminal.

## Troubleshooting stencil start missing module errors

If executing `stencil start` provokes errors like the following:

```text showLineNumbers copy
module.js:327
throw err;
^

Error: Cannot find module 'webpack'
at Function.Module._resolveFilename (module.js:325:15)
at Function.Module._load (module.js:276:25)
at Module.require (module.js:353:17)
at require (internal/module.js:12:17)
at Object. (/Users/jane.doe/themes/cornerstone/stencil.conf.js:2:15)
at Module._compile (module.js:409:26)
at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:416:10)
at Module.load (module.js:343:32)
at Function.Module._load (module.js:300:12)
at Module.require (module.js:353:17)
```

switch to your theme directory and run `npm install`. Running this command will add the missing JavaScript library dependencies.

If you receive the same error again after running `npm install`, you should completely uninstall and reinstall both the Stencil framework and Node.js.

## MacOS: Xcode/iOS license... errors

On MacOS, if you have recently installed a new version of Xcode, the command line will display the following error when you next try to use or reinstall Stencil:

```text
error: Agreeing to the Xcode/iOS license requires admin privileges, please re-run as root via sudo.
```

To resolve this error, do the following:
* Launch Xcode.
* Accept its user agreement.
* Quit Xcode.
* Re-execute your Stencil command.

## ETIMEOUT errors on Node > 4.4.0

If you are running a version of Node.js higher than 4.4.0, and you receive an `ETIMEOUT` error when running Stencil CLI, re-install the latest version of Stencil CLI to resolve this error by following the workflow in Installing Stencil CLI/Framework.

## Troubleshooting stencil command not found

### Reinstall Stencil CLI

If you receive the error message -bash: `stencil: command not found`, ensure that you have followed the steps on Installing Stencil CLI/Framework or attempt to reinstall the Stencil CLI.

### Redirect Bash shell

If you receive the error message -bash: stencil: command not found, enter echo $NVM_DIR. If this command returns nothing, then run source ~/.bash_profile and try running stencil commands again.

### Check/specify nvm version

If you receive a `stencil: command not found` error message upon executing stencil start from inside your theme subdirectory: Check whether nvm has installed multiple versions of Node.js, by entering the following command:

```shell copy
ls ~/.nvm/versions/node
```

If this reports more than one version, specify your platform's supported Node.js `<version_number>` by entering:

```shell copy
nvm use <version_number>
```

To prevent this error from recurring, add the same `nvm use <version_number>` command to your ~/.bash_profile file.

## Troubleshooting stencil start errors

### Unauthorized...username/token error

If executing the `stencil start` command generates an `Unauthorized, please use a valid username/token` error, make sure the `.stencil` file or `secrets.stencil.json` and `config.stencil.json` files (if using Stencil V3.1 release or later) contain the correct store URL. Also, verify that you copied the correct username and token. If you continue to get the same error, please reissue tokens.

### 403 errors

If the Stencil server responds with a `403` error and you are using a proxy-based domain service like Cloudflare or Amazon Cloudfront, modify your hosts file to map the localhost to your BigCommerce store IP address.

## 500 errors

If you see errors like or _similar_ to below:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 500,
  "error": "Internal Server Error",
  "message": "An internal server error occurred"
}
```

They often indicate a template syntax error, such as unmatched or missing punctuation. Check your terminal window for more details.

## Lint errors upon bundling

If bundling your theme triggers multiple lint errors related to the `bundle.js` file, your theme is missing the `.eslintignore` file. Retrieve this file from the [Cornerstone repo](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone), then re-run `stencil bundle`.

## Module not found errors upon bundling

If you see the following error when running stencil bundle, this is a past bug that has since been corrected.

```text
[ModuleNotFoundError: Module not found: Error: Cannot resolve module 'pace' in...]
```

To remove the error, please update your Cornerstone version.

## Short undescriptive JavaScript diagnostics

If JavaScript errors in your browser's developer tools are not reporting filenames and line numbers, try changing your `webpack.conf.js` file's sourcemap entry from:

```js copy
{
  devtool: 'eval-cheap-module-source-map'
}
```

to:

```js copy
{
  devtool: 'eval-source-map'
}
```

The `eval-cheap-module-source-map` option performs faster rebuilds, but omits line numbers. The `eval-source-map` option is slower, but more verbose.

## TR-300 error upon theme upload

If uploading your theme triggers a TR-300 error, this can indicate an included source-map file (`bundle.js.map`) that exceeds its size limit of 5 MB. If your `bundle.js.map` exceeds that limit, the workaround is to move this file outside your theme directory before re-running `stencil bundle`.

Other reasons for this error include exceeding these stencil theme limitations:
* Max file size for `/templates/` and `/parsed/templates/`: 1 MB
* Max for any single file in the bundle: 5 MB
* Max zipped size: 50 MB
* Max unzipped size: 100 MB
* Max total files: 2500

## Reinstalling Stencil CLI

If you encounter persistent problems in initializing or starting Stencil, you have the option of completely removing Stencil CLI and doing a fresh reinstall. You would do so as follows:

1. From your command line, issue the command:

```shell copy
npm uninstall -g @bigcommerce/stencil-cli
```

2. Navigate back to the Installing and Launching Stencil section and repeat all installation steps to reinstall dependencies and restore your theme, according to your development scenario.

A more drastic measure is to uninstall and reinstall Stencil CLI's Node.js prerequisites, along with uninstalling Stencil CLI. We do not recommend this, as it might disable other Node.js applications on your local machine.
