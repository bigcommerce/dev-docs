# Adding Stored Payment Methods

The [Cornerstone 2.6.0 release](/release-notes#posts/cornerstone-2-6-0-release) added stored payment method management for saved credit cards to the customer `account.php` page. The [Cornerstone 4.4.0 release](/release-notes#posts/cornerstone-4-4-0-release) expanded this functionality to include saving PayPal accounts using [PayPal Powered by Braintree](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Connecting-with-PayPal-Powered-by-Braintree). 

This article contains instructions for manually applying the changes made in `4.4.0` to themes version `2.6.0 ` to `4.3.1`. For a full diff of the files to change, see [Cornerstone pull request 1603 (GitHub)](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/pull/1603/files). If you're developing on a theme older than version `2.6.0` you'll first need to apply the changes made in `2.6.0`; to do so, see [Stored Credit Card Management](/archive/storefront/stencil/stored-credit-card-management). For theme update best practices, see [Theme Updates and Version Control](/docs/storefront/stencil/deployment/updates-and-version-control).

## Update `config.json`

In `config.json`, replace `account_payment_methods` in the `features` array with `account_payment_methods_v2` and add `csrf_protection`:

```json filename="config.json" showLineNumbers copy
{
  "name": "Cornerstone",
  "version": "4.3.1",
  "meta": {
    ...
    "features": [
      "fully_responsive",
      "mega_navigation",
      ...
      "csrf_protection",        //  add csrf_protection
      "account_payment_methods" //  replace with account_payment_methods_v2
    ]
  }
}
```

To enable saving PayPal accounts, credit cards, and other non-credit card payment methods using the theme, [add the supported_payment_methods array (GitHub)](https://github.com/leeBigCommerce/cornerstone/blob/54f5681a6a15cd8477c51c6db9eb54ea3eb40972/config.json#L325) and append `card` and `paypal` to it:

```json filename="config.json" showLineNumbers copy
{
  ...
  "supported_card_type_icons": [
    ...
  ],
  "supported_payment_methods": [ //  Add supported_payment_methods array
    "card",                      //  allowlist card and paypal
    "paypal"
  ],
  "lazyload_mode": "lazyload+lqip"
  ...
}
```

To see the full diff, refer to [Cornerstone pull request 1603 (GitHub)](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/pull/1603/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.html&file-filters%5B%5D=.json&file-filters%5B%5D=.md#diff-06b2d3b23dce96e1619d2b53d6c947ec).

## Update payment-methods-list.html

After you make the preceding config changes, you can pass a new version of the `payment_methods` object to the template.

To use the updated object, apply the changes from [Cornerstone pull request 1603 (GitHub)](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/pull/1603/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.html) to `payment-methods-list.html`.

The updated object shows saved PayPal accounts in the payment method list.

## Update edit-payment-method.html

The `customer.edit_stored_instrument` object has been lightly extended to include a `type` attribute.

Using `type`, you can show or hide fields based on whether the current instrument is a `stored_card` or `stored_paypal_account`. The type is also passed to the form handler in a hidden input so the handler can update the instrument accordingly.

Modify `edit-payment-method.html` to include changes from [Cornerstone pull request 1603 (GitHub)](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/pull/1603/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.html) to add the new user interface elements and behavior.

## Update `_paymentMethods.scss`

To style the newly added UI elements, update `_paymentMethods.scss` with the changes from [Cornerstone pull request 1603 (GitHub)](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/pull/1603/files?file-filters%5B%5D=#diff-1c33ed0c69f228483a39fce2616e1942).

## Add PayPal Logo

The changes to `payment-methods-list.html` include a PayPal logo that's displayed on the payment method cards:

```handlebars showLineNumbers copy
<img class="methodHeader-icon" src="{{cdn 'img/payment-methods/paypal.svg'}}" alt="{{lang 'account.payment_methods.paypal'}}" title="{{lang 'account.payment_methods.paypal'}}">
```

Use the command line to download the `.svg` and save it to `assets/img/payment-methods`:

```bash showLineNumbers copy
cd assets/img/payment-methods/paypal.svg
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leeBigCommerce/cornerstone/54f5681a6a15cd8477c51c6db9eb54ea3eb40972/assets/img/payment-methods/paypal.svg
```

## Update en.json

At minimum, an English translation needs to be added to `lang/en.json`: [Cornerstone pull request 1603 (GitHub)](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/pull/1603/files?file-filters%5B%5D=.html&file-filters%5B%5D=.json&file-filters%5B%5D=.md#diff-b0d4c1fc9d8d2a5a213b27a72cf6c9fe). Add translations for other locales as needed.


## Manage stored account payments

After adding a [stored payment method](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Enabling-Stored-Payment-Methods?language=en_US), shoppers can use the Storefront account payments microapp to manage their stored payment instruments. The microapp provides a payment method form with billing address fields. Currently, the microapp works with Adyen. Plans include expanding the number of supported payment processors.

### Install the microapp

To install the Storefront account payments microapp to your theme, inject the `account_payments` variable into the `add-payment-method.html` template.

```handlebars showLineNumbers copy
{{#if account_payments}}
    {{{ account_payments }}}
    <script>
        window.BigCommerce = window.BigCommerce || {};
    </script>
{{/if}}
```

The `account_payments` variable includes the `<div>` element that renders the microapp and a script tag containing the microapp URL. If the `window.BigCommerce` object does not yet exist, insert a script to create it. 

If the selected payment provider already has an integration with the Storefront account payments microapp, [initializing window.BigCommerce.renderAccountPayments](#initialize-the-microapp) renders the microapp automatically.

If the selected payment provider does not have an integration with the microapp, the `account_payments` variable is undefined and the fallback payment form renders. See an example of a fallback payment form and the conditional rendering logic from the [Cornerstone theme](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/templates/pages/account/add-payment-method.html#L45).

### Initialize the microapp

Initialize the microapp by calling the `renderAccountPayments()` method of the storefront browser's `window.BigCommerce` object. The Cornerstore theme initializes the microapp in the `account.js` file.

The `renderAccountPayments()` method takes the following three parameters:

* `style` - an options **object** for customizing the look of the microapp form. May be empty.
* `storeContextData` - an **object** that supplies store context. 
* `errorHandler` - a **function** that the microapp calls if the payments form submission fails.

```js filename="Example renderAccountPayments() wrapper function" copy
const initializeMicroapp = (style, storeContextData, errorHandler) => window.BigCommerce.renderAccountPayments(style, storeContextData, errorHandler);
```

This [Cornerstone example (GitHub)](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/assets/js/theme/account.js#L102) initializes `window.BigCommerce.renderAccountPayments` using JavaScript. 

The following example expresses the method's parameters as a TypeScript interface:

```ts filename="Example interface for renderAccountPayments()" showLineNumbers copy
interface AppConfigInterface {
  styles?: AppStyles;
  storeContextData: StoreContextDataInterface;
  errorHandler(error: string): void;
}
```

The following TypeScript interfaces express the data structures and types that `renderAccountPayments()` expects:

```ts showLineNumbers copy
interface AppStyles {
    inputBase?: CSSProperties;
    inputValidationError?: CSSProperties;
    inputValidationSuccess?: CSSProperties;
    submitButton?: CSSProperties;
    cancelButton?: CSSProperties;
    label?: CSSProperties;
    inputWrapper?: CSSProperties;
    validationError?: CSSProperties;
    heading?: CSSProperties;
    formRow?: CSSProperties;
    formActions?: CSSProperties;
}

interface StoreContextDataInterface {
    countries: Country[];
    paymentsUrl: string;
    storeHash: string;
    storeLocale: string;
    vaultToken: string;
    shopperId: string;
    customerEmail: string;
    providerId: PaymentProviders;
    currencyCode: string;
    paymentMethodsUrl: string;
    paymentProviderInitializationData: PaymentProviderInitializationData;
}

type PaymentProviderInitializationData =
  AdyenV2InitializationData
  | AdyenV3InitializationData;

interface AdyenV2InitializationData {
    clientKey?: string;
    environment: string;
    gateway: string;
    originKey: string;
}

interface AdyenV3InitializationData {
    clientKey: string;
    environment: string;
    gateway: string;
    originKey?: string;
}

interface Country {
    code: string;
    label: string;
    states?: State[];
    value: string;
}

interface State {
    code: string;
    name: string;
    value: string;
}

enum PaymentProviders {
    Adyenv2 = 'adyenv2',
    Adyenv3 = 'adyenv3',
}
```

## FAQ

**Where is the card data stored?**

Card data is stored securely with the payment gateway.

**Is storing credit cards PCI compliant?**

Card data is stored securely with the payment gateway. The BigCommerce store is NOT storing the payment data.

**Can shoppers modify their stored card?**

After adding a card, shoppers can modify the billing address. To modify other the other details, shoppers will need to delete and re-add the card.
