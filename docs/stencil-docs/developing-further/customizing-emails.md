## BigCommerce Legacy Email Templates
Email templates provide the framework for the store emails automatically sent to customers. You can edit these templates locally then upload them to the store via WebDav, or make changes to them directly in the store's control panel. For information on which user actions trigger these emails to be sent to a customer, see [Email Template Files and Snippets](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Customizing-Emails#template-files).

## Accessing and Editing Legacy Email Templates
To access and edit BigCommerce email templates: 

1. Connect to your store via the WebDav client of your choice. For more on connecting to a store via WebDav, see [File Access (WebDav)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/File-Access-WebDAV). 

2. Download the base templates from the `/email_templates/` folder.
3. Make changes to the templates locally. Re-upload modified templates to the `/email_templates/` folder.
