# Global Objects and Properties

Global objects and properties are common components shared across the entire BigCommerce storefront.

<Callout type="info">
  #### Debugging Your Theme
  The Stencil framework provides built-in debugging tools to aid in your custom front-end development. When you want to see what data is available on the page you are working on, you can simply add the debug query string to your store’s localhost URL. For example:
  `http://localhost:3000/product/this-is-a-sample-product?debug=context` will return a list of all the objects available on the page, in JSON syntax. 
  If you want to view the available JSON objects and rendered page at the same time, simply change the debug value to "bar": `http://localhost:3000/product/this-is-a-sample-product?debug=bar`

## Featured Products

**Description:** Renders a list of all the featured products for the BigCommerce storefront.

**Handlebars Expression:** `{{products.featured}}`

**Object Properties:** References the [product card model](/stencil-docs/stencil-object-model-reference/stencil-objects/common-objects/common-product-card-model).

**Usage Example:**

The code example below displays the global `{{products.featured}}` object on the `cornerstone/templates/pages/home.html` page template from [Stencil's base Cornerstone theme](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/templates/pages/home.html#L5) (GitHub).

`{{products.featured}}` returns 10 products by default.

First, you must declare the object using Front Matter. To declare the object, the following front matter must be placed at the top of the template HTML page. This following declaration also limits the number of featured products to be displayed:

```yml filename="Example: Frontmatter declaration" showLineNumbers
products:
  [...]
  featured:
    limit: {{theme_settings.homepage_featured_products_count}} //limits the number of featured products to be displayed.
```

The `homepage_featured_products_count` limit is one of two relevant variables defined in [Cornerstone's `config.json` file](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json#L45) (GitHub).

```json filename="homepage_featured_products_count" showLineNumbers
"settings": {
  // ...
  "homepage_featured_products_count": 8,
  // ...
  "homepage_featured_products_column_count": 4,
  // ...    
}
```

In the body of [Cornerstone's `home.html` template](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/templates/pages/home.html#L27) (GitHub), the below Handlebars conditional statement is responsible for displaying the `{{products.featured}}` object. This is the object that we declared above using front matter.

```handlebars filename="home.html" showLineNumbers
{{#if products.featured}}
  {{> components/products/featured products=products.featured columns=theme_settings.homepage_featured_products_column_count}}
{{/if}}
```

This above statement formats the _Featured Products_ display according to the `homepage_featured_products_column_count` variable, which is the second relevant variable defined in [Cornerstone's `config.json` file](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json#L53) (GitHub).

## Footer

No properties available for this object.

## New Products

**Description:** A list of new products for the BigCommerce storefront

**Handlebars Expression:**`{{products.new}}`

**Object Properties:** References the [product card model](/stencil-docs/stencil-object-model-reference/stencil-objects/common-objects/common-product-card-model).

**Usage Example:**

To access the global `{{products.new}}` object on your page, you must first use front matter to declare the object at the top of your page template.

`{{products.new}}` returns 10 products by default. 

The code example below declares the global `{{products.new}}` object on the `cornerstone/templates/pages/home.html` page template from [Stencil's base Cornerstone Theme](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/templates/pages/home.html#L3) (GitHub).

```yml filename="Example: Frontmatter declaration" showLineNumbers
products:
  new:
    limit: {{theme_settings.homepage_new_products_count}}
```

The `homepage_featured_products_count` limit is one of two relevant variables defined in Cornerstone's `config.json` file (GitHub).

```json filename="config.json" showLineNumbers
"settings": {
  "homepage_new_products_count": 5,
  // ...
  "homepage_new_products_column_count": 4,
  // ...
}
```

In the body of [Cornerstone's home.html template](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/templates/pages/home.html#L36) (GitHub), the below Handlebars conditional statement is responsible for displaying the `{{products.featured}}` object. This is the object that we declared above using front matter.

```handlebars filename="home.html" showLineNumbers
{{#if products.new}}
  {{> components/products/new products=products.new columns=theme_settings.homepage_new_products_column_count}}
{{/if}}
```

This above statement formats the _New Products_ display according to the `homepage_new_products_column_count` variable, which is the second relevant variable defined in [Cornerstone's config.json file](https://github.com/bigcommerce/cornerstone/blob/master/config.json#L46) (GitHub
