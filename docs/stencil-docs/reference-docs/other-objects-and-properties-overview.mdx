# Other Objects and Properties Overview
 

<Callout type="info">
  #### Debugging Your Theme
  The Stencil framework provides built-in debugging tools to aid in your custom front-end development. When you want to see what data is available on the page you are working on, you can simply add the debug query string to your store’s localhost URL. For example:
  `http://localhost:3000/product/this-is-a-sample-product?debug=context` will return a list of all the objects available on the page, in JSON syntax.
  If you want to view the available JSON objects and rendered page at the same time, change the debug value to "bar": `http://localhost:3000/product/this-is-a-sample-product?debug=bar`
</Callout>

### Strikeout Pricing Example

As a theme developer, you can use the `{{cart.items.rrp}}` property to display strike-out pricing in the Cart context. Here is the general approach:

In your `templates/components/cart/content.html` file, as you iterate over the list of items in the cart, you would check each item's `type`. (No `rrp` property is available where the `type` is `GiftCertificate`.)

If the type is `Item`, then you would check the `{{cart.items.rrp}}` value. If the value is _not_ `null`, then you would know that you can display a strike-out price for the item. Below is a sample code skeleton:

```handlebars filename="templates/components/cart/content.html" showLineNumbers
{{#each cart.items}}
   <!--...-->
  {{#if type '==' 'GiftCertificate'}}
      {{#if rrp}}
          <!-- your code to display strike-thru pricing -->
      {{else}}
          <!-- your code to display normal pricing -->
      {{/if}}
  {{/if}}
{{/each}}
```

For further details about catalog price properties, please see [Catalog Price Object: How Properties Interact](/stencil-docs/conditional-logic-examples/catalog-price-object). For usage examples of the `{{cart.items}}` `price` and `total` properties, please see [Cart Price Properties](/stencil-docs/conditional-logic-examples/cart-price-relationships).
